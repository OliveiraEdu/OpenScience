There is a need to understand the research ecosystem, and improvements will require combined efforts across all parts of this ecosystem. National structures can play an important role in coordinating these efforts, working collaboratively with researchers, institutions, funders, publishers, learned societies and other sectoral organisations, and providing a monitoring and reporting function. Whilst many new ways of working and emerging innovations hold a great deal of promise, it will be important to invest in meta-research activity to ensure that these approaches are evidence based, work as intended, and do not have unintended consequences. Addressing reproducibility will require working collaboratively across the research ecosystem to share best practice and to make the most effective use of resources. The UK Reproducibility Network (UKRN) brings together Local Networks of researchers, Institutions, and External Stakeholders (funders, publishers, learned societies and other sectoral organisations), to coordinate action on reproducibility and work to ensure the UK retains its place as a centre for world-leading research. This activity is coordinated by the UKRN Steering Group. We consider this structure as valuable, bringing together a range of voices at a range of levels to support the combined efforts required to enact change.", "container-title": "BMC Research Notes", "DOI": "10.1186/s13104-022-05942-3", "ISSN": "1756-0500", "issue": "1", "journalAbbreviation": "BMC Res Notes", "language": "en", "page": "43", "source": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "title": "The reproducibility debate is an opportunity, not a crisis", "URL": "https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-05942-3", "volume": "15", "author": [{"family": "Munaf\u00f2", "given": "Marcus R."}, {"family": "Chambers", "given": "Chris"}, {"family": "Collins", "given": "Alexandra"}, {"family": "Fortunato", "given": "Laura"}, {"family": "Macleod", "given": "Malcolm"}], "accessed": {"date-parts": [["2022", 10, 12]]}, "issued": {"date-parts": [["2022", 12]]}}, "ipfs_hash": "QmUSDqEVZ7pkHDzY8BMA83YzFgnDo7Nnf6VeqaUU579gDd"}}
