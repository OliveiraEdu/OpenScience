The scientific community has been grappling with a pressing issue, the reproducibility crisis. Studies have consistently shown that a significant number of published findings fail to hold up under rigorous scrutiny when retested or replicated by other researchers (Open Science Framework, 2020). This crisis can be attributed to various factors, including poor study design, flawed measurement tools, and inadequate reporting of methods, data, and materials used in research studies. The consequences of this crisis are far-reaching, undermining the credibility of scientific research and jeopardizing the progress of innovation.

The Open Science movement has emerged as a promising approach to address the reproducibility issues. This paradigm shift advocates for transparency, collaboration, and accessibility in scientific research (Pinfield & Hartley, 2016). By making research findings and data available for others to access, use, and build upon, researchers can increase the reliability and validity of scientific knowledge. The Open Science movement also fosters a culture of trust, collaboration, and accountability among researchers, institutions, and the broader public.

Despite its potential, the widespread adoption of Open Science has been hindered by concerns about intellectual property rights, privacy, and security (Bollen et al., 2018). To overcome these challenges, blockchain technology offers a robust technical support for enabling Open Science and reducing the reproducibility problem. Blockchain's decentralized, secure, and transparent nature allows for the creation of immutable records of research data, methods, and findings. This ensures that data integrity is maintained, and researchers can trust the accuracy and reliability of shared information.

Smart contracts, executed on blockchain platforms, can automate various processes involved in scientific research, such as peer review and manuscript vetting (Buterin, 2018). This not only streamlines the research process but also enhances transparency by providing a tamper-proof record of decisions and actions. The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), another key component of blockchain technology, enables the decentralized storage and sharing of large datasets and other scientific artifacts as well, making it easier to collaborate and reproduce results.

The integration of smart contracts and IPFS further enhances the robustness and efficiency of this approach, enabling the scientific community to build trust and credibility. By leveraging these technologies, researchers can create a secure and transparent environment for data sharing, collaboration, and knowledge discovery. This, in turn, can lead to faster breakthroughs, improved innovation, and more reliable scientific findings.

Ultimately, the combination of Open Science principles along with the support of decentralized technologies has the potential to revolutionize the way scientific research is conducted, recorded, and disseminated. By addressing the root causes of the reproducibility crisis, researchers can foster a culture of trust, collaboration, and accountability that benefits not only individual scientists but also society as a whole.
