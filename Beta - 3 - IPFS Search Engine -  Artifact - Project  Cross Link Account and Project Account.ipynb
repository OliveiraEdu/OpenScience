A novel automated technique for DR detection has been proposed in this paper. To \\naccentuate the lesions, the fundus images (FIs) were preprocessed using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram \\nEqualization (CLAHE). A parallel convolutional neural network (PCNN) was employed for feature extraction and \\nthen the extreme learning machine (ELM) technique was utilized for the DR classification. In comparison to the \\nsimilar CNN structure, the PCNN design uses fewer parameters and layers, which minimizes the time required to \\nextract distinctive features. The effectiveness of the technique was evaluated on two datasets (Kaggle DR 2015 \\ncompetition (Dataset 1; 34,984 FIs) and APTOS 2019 (3,662 FIs)), and the results are promising. For the two \\ndatasets mentioned, the proposed technique attained accuracies of 91.78 % and 97.27 % respectively. However, \\none of the study’s subsidiary discoveries was that the proposed framework demonstrated stability for both larger \\nand smaller datasets, as well as for balanced and imbalanced datasets. Furthermore, in terms of classifier per-\\nformance metrics, model parameters and layers, and prediction time, the suggested approach outscored existing \\nstate-of-the-art models, which would add significant benefit for the medical practitioners in accurately identi-\\nfying the DR.   \\n\\n1. Introduction \\n\\nDiabetic retinopathy (DR) is a chronic retinal disease that is regarded \\nas the sixth most common cause of blindness worldwide. It’s a hidden \\nprogressive chronic disease among the diabetic patients. According to \\nthe 2013 statistics, 382 million people are affected by diabetes-related \\nretinal disease, and by 2025, it is projected to exceed 592 million \\n(Pandey & Sharma, 2018). DR shows no clear early sign of appearance; \\nas the condition degrades, complete blindness is basically the obvious \\nend result. Regular screening can help to identify the DR at an early \\nstage, which can help in arresting any further damage through appro-\\npriate medication. Fundus images (FIs) with high resolution are utilized \\nfor detecting the teensy lesions and grading the severity level. Non- \\nproliferative DR (NPDR) and proliferative DR (PDR) are the two \\n\\nprimary forms of the DR.

New blood \\nvessels are formed in the PDR stage, along with the aforementioned \\nanomalies (Chudzik et al., 2018). \\n\\nDR is diagnosed using fundus images. Expert ophthalmologists find \\nexisting lesions on the images based on which they grade the DR level \\nand suggest appropriate treatment accordingly. As the lesions are small \\nand often having an overlapping boundaries between the consecutive \\nDR grades, even the expert ophthalmologists cannot provide consistent \\ndiagnosis for the same fundus images and it is also a time-consuming \\nprocess. Therefore, an urgent need for a computer-aided system has \\nbeen realized by the research community. \\n\\nVarious computer-aided systems have been proposed so far for the \\nDR screening. Ophthalmologists grade the severity level by screening \\nthe lesions present in FIs and providing treatment based on the level. \\nSome lesion segmentation techniques were developed to copy this style \\nto mark out these tiny lesions and assist the ophthalmologists in correct \\ndiagnosis. Image processing techniques were frequently used for seg-\\nmenting lesions of FIs. Using image processing techniques, Mumtaz et al. \\n(2018), showed the automatic identification of one of the red lesions, i. \\ne., hemorrhage, which is one of the most recognizable symptoms of \\nretinal disorders among diabetic patients. Akram et al. (2014), detected \\nthe MA from small patches extracted from the FIs while PCA was used \\nfor dimensionality reduction. Rahim et al. (2016), used fuzzy C-means \\n(FCM) image processing techniques to provide a novel automated \\ndiagnosis of the DR and maculopathy in eye fundus pictures. Kar and \\nMaity (2017), developed a four-part lesion detection technique that \\nincluded extraction of vessels and removal of the optic disc, pre- \\nprocessing, detection of candidate lesion, and post-processing. The \\ndark lesions were separated from the weakly lit retinal backgrounds \\nusing curvelet-based edge enhancement, while the contrast between the \\nbright lesions and the background was improved using a well-designed \\nwideband bandpass filter. Subsequently, the mutual information of the \\nmaximum matched filter response and the maximum Laplacian of \\nGaussian response was maximized together. Finally, morphology-based \\npost-processing was used to exclude the candidate pixels that were \\nincorrectly identified. Umapathy et al. (2019), extracted texture features \\nusing the image processing and classified by Decision Tree (DT) classi-\\nfier. For the second method the authors utilized the transfer learning \\nmethod. As the complex features were extracted using the image pro-\\ncessing technique, the accuracy was not so high. For this, deep learning \\nmodels were also proposed for the lesion segmentation. For the seg-\\nmentation of microaneurysms, Chudzik et al. (2018), presented a patch- \\nbased Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with batch normalization \\nlayers and a dice loss function Pixel-wise exudate detection with a deep \\nCNN was proposed by Yu et al. (2017). Gondal et al. (2017), presented a \\nweakly-supervised CNN model that highlighted denoting regions of the \\nretinal images. The authors obtained high classification and sensitivity \\nscores. The Mask-RCNN model was proposed to segment small lesions \\n(MA and exudates) by Shenavarmasouleh and Arabnia (2007). The \\n\\nauthors utilized the transfer learning (TL) approach to reuse the pre- \\ntrained model ResNet101′s weights and achieved an mAP score of 45 \\n%. Besides segmentation, image-level classification is also popular for \\nthe DR grading. The whole image is classified into its classification \\ngrades based on unique features in the image-level classification. \\n\\nSeveral of the studies utilized traditional machine learning (ML) \\nmethods such as DT, support vector machine (SVM), Random forests \\n(RF), logistic regression (LR), and Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB). For \\nusing traditional ML-based classification, features were extracted using \\nimage processing techniques later deployed to develop the models. For \\nexample, Lachure et al. (2015), used morphological image processing \\nlike erosion, dilation, opening, closing, etc., to segment MAs and exu-\\ndates. Later the features were fed to the SVM and k-nearest neighbors \\n(KNN) classifiers for grading the FIs. Asha and Karpagavalli (2015), \\ndetected retinal exudates using machine learning techniques where the \\nFIs were segmented using the fuzzy C means algorithm, then exudates \\nfeatures were detected from the Luv color space. The classifiers utilized \\nincluded NB, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Extreme Learning Ma-\\nchine (ELM), with ELM providing the best results. ML techniques for \\nautomatically identifying and categorizing the DR from the retina im-\\nages were studied by Honnungar et al. (2016). The proposed method \\nentailed image preprocessing (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram \\nEqualization, CLAHE), feature extraction using the bag of visual words \\nmodel, and image classification into distinct DR phases using a multi- \\nclass classifier (logistic regression, SVM, and RF). Raman et al. applied \\nCLAHE to enhance the images, then Sobel operator and contour with \\ncircular hough transformation for optic disk segmentation, morpholog-\\nical operation for blood vessel segmentation, regions growing for exu-\\ndates segmentation, and a mixture model for microaneurysm \\nsegmentation (Raman et al., 2016). Finally, an artificial neural network \\n(ANN) was used as a classifier. Carrera et al. (2017), utilized image \\nprocessing to isolate blood vessels, microaneurysms, and hard exudates \\nfor extracting features, which were later deployed to the SVM classifier. \\nThey obtained a sensitivity of 95 % and an accuracy of 94 %. Soma-\\nsundaram and Ali (2017), developed a ML bagging ensemble classifier \\n(ML-BEC) and extracted t-distribution Stochastic Neighbor Embedding \\n(t-SNE) features. Ramani et al. (2017), proposed a two-level classifica-\\ntion for the DR grading. Ensemble of Best First Trees (BFTs) was used, \\nwhereas misclassified instances were removed and deployed to second \\nlevel ensemble classifiers with J48 Graft Trees. Using Local Ternary \\nPattern (LTP) and Local Energy-based Shape Histogram, Chetoui et al. \\n(2018), identified texture characteristics (LESH). For classification, SVM \\nwas used with various kernel functions. For feature representation, a \\nhistogram binning method was utilized. They demonstrated that using \\nSVM with an RBF kernel, LESH is the best method, with an accuracy of \\n90 %. ML approaches for segmentation and categorization of the DR \\nwere presented by Ali et al. (2020). They proposed a new regional- \\ngrowing paradigm based on clustering. They used four types of char-\\nacteristics for texture analysis: histogram (H), wavelet (W), co- \\noccurrence matrix (COM), and run-length matrix (RLM). The authors \\nutilized data fusion to create hybrid-feature datasets to increase classi-\\nfication accuracy. To obtain 13 optimal features, they used Fisher, \\ncorrelation-based feature selection, mutual information, and probability \\nof error plus average correlation. Finally, five classifiers were used: SMO \\n(sequential minimum optimization), Lg (logistic), MLP (multilayer \\nperceptron), and SLg (simple logistic). Gayathri et al. (2021), designed a \\nmultipath convolutional neural network (M− CNN) for extracting global \\nand local features from fundus images. Then SVM, RF, and J48 classifiers \\nwere used for the final DR grade prediction. The M− CNN network ob-\\ntained the best result with the J48 classifier. Mahmoud et al. (2021), \\nintroduced a hybrid inductive ML algorithm (HIMLA) for automatic DR \\ndetection. \\n\\nColor FIs were normalized and a convolutional encoder-decoder was \\nused for segmenting blood vessels. A multiple instance learning tech-\\nnique was utilized for feature extraction and classification. Reddy et al. \\n(2020), experimented with an ensemble learning method with \\n\\nFig. 1.

Nahiduzzaman et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \\n\\n\\n\\nExpert Systems With Applications 217 (2023) 119557\\n\\n3\\n\\nAdaboost, RF, DT, KNN, and Logistic Regression. The authors used the \\ngrid search technique for hyperparameter tuning. Odeh et al. (2016), \\nproposed an ensemble method using RF for robust and powerful \\nlearning, NN for improving precision, and SVM for accurate, time-saving \\nprediction. For feature selection, the authors used info gain attribute \\nevaluation and wrapper subset evaluation algorithms. \\n\\nOne problem with the traditional ML is that the complex features \\nneed to be extracted first. This manual feature extraction using image \\nprocessing sometimes fail to capture all the complex features necessary \\nfor an accurate classification. Here comes the deep learning (DL) \\napproach, which is used for imaging in a wide range of applications \\nnowadays. DL models were also deployed in the DR identification with \\nsignificant success through accurate extraction of the complex feature \\nusing the convolution layers. A 4 × 4 kernel-based CNN architecture \\nwith some preprocessing and augmentation methods was proposed by \\nIslam et al. (2018), for detecting the DR where the authors employed L2 \\nregularizer and dropout to eliminate overfitting and achieved 98 % \\nsensitivity and 94 % specificity with a kappa score of 85 %. Zhou et al. \\n(2018), proposed a multitasking deep learning model for the DR \\ngrading. Because of the interrelationship among the DR stages, the au-\\nthors followed the multitasking approach that predicted the labels with \\nboth the classification and regression and got a kappa score of 84 %. A \\nSiamese-like architecture was also proposed for the DR detection by \\nZeng et al. (2019). The model used binocular fundus images as input and \\nwas trained with a transfer learning strategy. An attention-based DL \\nmodel, BiRA-Net was proposed by Zhao et al. (2019). Islam et al. (2020), \\nproposed a VGG16 based transfer learning approach with a color pre-\\nprocessing version. The authors used stratified K-fold cross-validation to \\nreduce the overfitting problem. For a smaller Kaggle dataset, Samanta \\net al. (2020), suggested transfer learning-based DenseNet and attained a \\nkappa score of 0.8836 on the validation set. On the Messidor-1 and \\nAPTOS datasets, Gangwar and Ravi (2021), used a pre-trained model, \\nInception-ResNet-v2, and built a custom layer on top, achieving an ac-\\ncuracy of 72.33 % and 82.18 % respectively. Islam et al. (2021), \\ndeveloped a customized VGG19 model and down sampling technique for \\nDR detection. Majumder and Kehtarnavaz (2021), proposed a multi-\\ntasking deep learning model to detect the five grades of the DR \\ncomposed of one regression model, one classification model, and one \\nregression model for inter-dependency. For the APTOS and EyePACS \\ndatasets, they achieved a kappa score of 90 % and 88 %. Also, an inte-\\ngrated shallow network was proposed by Chen et al. (2020). \\n\\nThough various models have been developed, still further improve-\\nment is required particularly in the case of multiclass classification. \\nSeveral ML models were employed in some research, but in this case, the \\nclassification performance was not satisfactory despite the model \\ncomplexity being lower than the existing DL models. Researchers used \\ndifferent transfer learning (TL) models to achieve higher classification \\nperformance to overcome these shortcomings. However, the TL models \\nhave a vast number of parameters, layers and consume a lot of time for \\ntraining. Therefore, this study proposes a framework that makes a trade- \\noff between the ML and DL models, increasing classification perfor-\\nmance and reducing the vast number of parameters and layers, which \\nreduces the processing time. In this study, the FIs were preprocessed \\nusing CLAHE to highlight the lesions of DR. A lightweight parallel CNN \\nmodel has been developed to extract the most discriminant features, \\nwhich are standardized using a standard scaler. Finally, a single-layer \\nML algorithm model named ELM has been used for classification of \\nthe DR. The proposed framework brings its novelty through a smaller \\nnumber of parameters, layers, and comparatively lower processing time. \\nThe proposed framework also offers versatile capabilities in any domain, \\nfor instance, small or large datasets, balanced or imbalanced datasets, \\nand low-resolution FIs. \\n\\n2. Dataset description \\n\\nIn this study, two prevalent datasets were used: Kaggle DR 2015 \\n\\ncompetition (Dataset 1) and APTOS, 2019 respectively provided by \\nEyePACS and Aravind Eye Hospital via Kaggle (California Healthcare \\nFoundation, 2019; APTOS, 2019). The datasets contained five grades of \\nthe DR to detect with 34,984 FIs in Dataset 1 and 3,662 images in \\nAPTOS, 2019. 80 % of the data was used for training, and the rest was for \\ntesting. During image extraction from the Kaggle DR 2015 dataset, some \\nFIs were lost. As both the datasets were collected from Kaggle compe-\\ntition, their corresponding test images were kept in private. Hence, only \\nthe trained data was used for the DR classification. The trained dataset \\nthen further split into both training and testing set for carried out the \\nclassification task. Table 1 shows the number of FIs per class for both \\ndatasets. Representative samples from each class are demonstrated in \\nFig. 2. \\n\\n3. Proposed framework \\n\\nAn adequate framework was proposed in this study for severity \\ngrading of the DR. The benefits of ML and DL algorithms were merged to \\ndevelop a robust framework with a trade-off between the model’s pro-\\ncessing performance and classification performance. Fig. 3 exhibits the \\nproposed framework to detect DR from the FIs. First, the FIs were pre-\\nprocessed using CLAHE to highlight the lesions more clearly, then \\nnormalized and finally reshaped. Afterward, a lightweight CNN model \\nwas developed to extract the most discriminant features from the pro-\\ncessed FIs. The extracted features were standardized to be fed into the \\nELM algorithm, which to classify the severity level of the DR. In the \\nsubsequent sections, all components of the framework have been \\nexplained comprehensively. \\n\\n3.1. Pre-processing \\n\\nImage preprocessing is crucial for medical image analysis because \\nthe classification performance varies depending on how well the image \\nhas been preprocessed. CLAHE reveals a favorable result for enhancing \\nimage quality in the case of medical image preprocessing (Nahiduzza-\\nman et al., 2021a,b). Since the datasets contained different quality of \\nimages, hence for improving the quality of low contrast images while \\nfocusing on the lesions of FIs, CLAHE was utilized. The intensification in \\nCLAHE was controlled by clipping the histogram at a user-defined value \\ncalled the clip limit. The clipping level determined the amount of \\ndistortion in the histogram should be eliminated and this defined the \\nlimit of contrast adjustment. In this study, the tile size was (4 × 4), and \\nthe clip limit was 2.0 while using the color version of the CLAHE. After \\napplying CLAHE, the FIs have been normalized dividing by 255 to make \\neach image range between 0 and 1, which also reduced the complexity \\nof the model. Since the datasets contained diverse FIs, making the FIs \\nwith the same size was an essential step to follow. Hence, the FIs were \\nresized to (124 × 124) to fit into the CNN model. Fig. 4 shows the effect \\nof CLAHE in the FIs. \\n\\n3.2. Features extraction using parallel convolutional layers \\n\\nOne of the main focuses of this study was to design a CNN that \\nreduced both parameters and layers, which eventually shortened the \\nprocessing time while extracting the most prominent features.

Basically, in CNN, the convolutional layer (CL) was posi-\\ntioned sequentially for obtaining the best features. For instance, select-\\ning a small number of CL layers might result in the loss of some \\n\\ndiscriminant features, whereas a large number of CL layers might lead to \\noverfitting the model. Hence, the number of CL layers needed to be \\nchosen adequately to extract the most relevant features. In this study, six \\nCL layers were selected to extract the prominent features while reducing \\n\\nFig. 2.

The lightweight parallax CNN has been shown in Fig. 5. \\nIn the lightweight parallel CNN, four CLs were placed in parallel, \\n\\nwhich resulted in lowering the parameters and processing time. Since \\nthe four CLs were run in parallel, which could be considered as a single \\nCL but performed just like four CLs. The size of each CL was 64. The \\nkernel sizes of the first, second, third, and fourth CLs were 9 × 9, 7 × 7, \\n5 × 5, and 3 × 3, respectively and the activation function was ReLU. In \\nthis study, the padding size was kept the same in the first four CLs to \\ncheck the border element. As sometimes the border element might hold \\nimportant information in the FIs which were checked using the same \\npadding. Afterwards, the result of these parallel CLs were concatenated \\nand fed into the sequential CNN. The sizes of the last two CLs were 32 \\nand 16, respectively, with a kernel size of 3 × 3. The padding size in the \\nrest of the CLs was kept “valid”. Each CL was followed by batch \\nnormalization, activation, and a max-pooling layer. Max-pooling with 2 \\n× 2 filters was used to extract the most important regions of the FIs by \\nobtaining the highest value in each region at the CLs. There were two \\nfully connected (FC) layers, and the features were extracted from the last \\nFC layer. Two dropouts were used with a 0.5 probability: one after the \\nlast CL and another after the first FC layer. Dropout was used to reduce \\noverfitting and speed up the training process by randomly skipping 50 % \\nof all nodes. For extracting the features, the CNN model was run for 50 \\nepochs with a batch size 64 while considering the learning rate of 0.001 \\nwith the ADAM optimizer and handling the loss using sparse categorical \\ncross-entropy. A total of 120 features were selected from the last FC \\nlayer by using a trial-and-error process. The summary of the CNN model \\nis shown in Table 2. \\n\\n3.3. Extreme learning machine \\n\\nBefore fitting the features into ELM, features were standardized by \\nsubtracting the mean and scaling to mean–variance. The standard scaler \\nwas employed to regularize the extracted features, which improved the \\nclassification performance of the models (), (Nahiduzzaman et al., \\n2019). The standard score for the sample x has been calculated using Eq. \\n(1) (Farrell and Saloner, 1985). \\n\\ny =\\nx − x\\n\\nσ (1)  \\n\\nwhere x is the mean of the samples and σ is the standard deviation of the \\nsamples. \\n\\nHuang et al. (2006), proposed ELM, a forward feed network-based \\nneural network. The standardized 120 features were classified using a \\nsingle hidden layer. The number of nodes in the hidden layer for Dataset- \\n1 and APTOS, 2019 were 1000 and 200, respectively, which were \\nselected by trial-and-error method. The number of nodes in the input \\nand output layers of the ELM model for both datasets were 120 and 5, \\nrespectively, whereas the ReLU was used as an activation function. Due \\nto the absence of backpropagation, the training time was a thousand \\ntimes faster than the typical NN, resulting in better generalization power \\nand higher classification performance (Huang et al. (2006); Nahi-\\nduzzaman et al., 2021a,b). The parameters from the input to the hidden \\nlayer were calculated randomly, whereas the parameters from the hid-\\nden layer to the output layer were calculated using pseudoinverse. For \\nextracting features using lightweight CNN, the entire trainable param-\\neters for the DR classification are 3, 505,939.

Result and discussion \\n\\nSeveral performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1- \\nscore, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) curve, were used to evaluate the \\nperformance of the proposed framework. Equations (2) through Equa-\\ntion (6) can be used to define the metrics (Powers, 2010). \\n\\nAccuracy =\\nTP + TN\\n\\nTP + TN + FP + FN\\n(2)  \\n\\nPrecision =\\nTP\\n\\nTP + FP\\n(3)  \\n\\nRecall =\\nTP\\n\\nTN + FP\\n(4)  \\n\\nF1 − Score =\\n2 × (Precision × Recall)\\n\\nPrecision + Recall\\n(5)  \\n\\nAUC =\\n1\\n2\\n(\\n\\nTP\\n\\nTP + FN\\n+\\n\\nTN\\n\\nTN + FP\\n) (6)  \\n\\nwhere true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives \\nare symbolized as TP, TN, FP and FN, respectively. True positives indi-\\ncated that the normal patients were correctly detected as normal, true \\nnegatives indicated that the DR affected patients were correctly identi-\\nfied as DR whereas false positives indicated that the normal patients \\nwere wrongly detected as DR and false negatives indicated that the DR \\npatients were wrongly detected as normal. \\n\\nPyCharm Community Edition (2021.2.3) software was used to run all \\nof the codes, which were written in the python programming language. \\nKeras was used to build the CNN model, with TensorFlow as the back-\\nend. The ELM models were trained and tested on a PC with a 64-bit \\nWindows 10 Pro operating system, an Intel (R) Core (TM) i9-11900 \\nCPU @ 2.50 GHz, 32 GB of RAM, and an NVIDIA GeForce, RTX 3090 \\n24 GB GPU. \\n\\nIn this section, the different types of performance were investigated \\nto show the robustness of the proposed framework. A lightweight \\ncustomized CNN has extracted 120 prominent features from the pre-\\nprocessed FIs. These prominent features were further preprocessed and \\nfitted into the ELM model to classify different levels of DR. In abridge-\\nment, the feature deriving capability was incorporated with the ELM. \\nThe proposed combination was examined with two datasets. \\n\\n4.1. Results of Dataset-1 \\n\\nThe ELM model was trained using 27,978 FIs, whereas the numbers \\nof No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, and PDR FIs were 20566, 1948, 4214, \\n695, and 564 respectively. The training process required only one iter-\\nation as there was no backpropagation in the ELM. Therefore, the ELM \\ntraining process was faster than the traditional neural network (NN) and \\nthe DL models. Another point that needs to be noted was that to classify \\nthe DR levels correctly, a number of iterations needs to be carried out to \\ntrain the NN and DL models. However, in this study, the proposed ELM \\nachieved a promising result for only one epoch for both the datasets. \\nAfter completing the training, 6,997 FIs (No DR: 5141, Mild: 487, \\nModerate: 1054, Severe: 174, and PDR: 141) were employed for \\nassessing the classification performance of the ELM model. The CM \\nobtained by the ELM for Dataset-1 is shown in Fig. 6. Clearly, in the case \\nmoderate level, misclassified number of images were much higher than \\nthe other levels. \\n\\nThe average precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy of the ELM for \\ndataset-1 were 0.91, 0.83, 0.87, and 91.78 %, respectively, as shown in \\nTable 3. Furthermore, to demonstrate the superior performance of ELM \\nin this study, five well-known ML algorithms such as SVM, GNB, RF, DT \\nand LR were also employed to obtain the classification results as pre-\\nsented in Tables 3–5 and Fig. 7. The best classification results were \\nobtained from SVM among these five models. The average precision, \\nrecall, f1-score, and accuracy of the SVM were 0.58, 0.44, 0.49, 75.83 % \\nrespectively which were also quite lower than ELM. In fact, SVM pro-\\nduced good results during the binary classification whereas NN models \\nshowed good results for multiclass classifications (Nahiduzzaman et al., \\n2019). As ELM is like traditional NN except the back-propagation al-\\ngorithm and for that reason ELM is faster and the rate of learning and \\ngeneralization are more effective. This provides promising results in the \\ncase of multiclass classifications (Afza et al., 2021; Alenezi et al., 2023). \\n\\nThe average AUC of the ELM for the Dataset-1 was 95.08 %, whereas \\nthe class-wise AUCs of the ELM are demonstrated in Fig. 7. It was \\nobserved that each class contributed almost equally to the final classi-\\nfication result (AUC values for all classes higher than 92 %). It could be \\nconcluded that though the class distribution was imbalanced, the pro-\\nposed framework showed its consistency in detecting every class of DR. \\n\\nFig. 6.

Results of APTOS, 2019 Dataset \\n\\nIn the previous section, the proposed framework revealed promising \\nresults for the Dataset-1, which contained a total of 34,984 FIs. Since the \\nDL models worked well for larger datasets, the proposed framework \\nvalidated this by showing favorable classification performance. In this \\nstudy, it was also checked whether the proposed framework could \\nachieve promising classification performance with a small dataset. \\nHence, a small dataset, APTOS, 2019 was used that contained FIs, almost \\nten times less than the Dataset-1. \\n\\nAmong the total 3,662 FIs, 2,929 FIs were used for training the ELM \\n\\nand other five ML models, whereas the numbers of No DR, Mild, Mod-\\nerate, Severe, and PDR were 1444, 296, 799, 154, and 236, respectively. \\nFor evaluating the ELM classification performance, a CM was developed \\nusing 733 FIs (No DR: 361, Mild: 74, Moderate: 200, Severe: 39, and \\nPDR: 59). The level-wise precision, f1-score and recall shown in \\nTables 6–8 demonstrated that the ELM model performed well in the case \\nof the imbalance or smaller dataset. The best accuracy (97.27 %) was \\nachieved by ELM model for the APTOS, 2019 dataset with a recall of 95 \\n\\nTable 3 \\nClassification performance comparison by Precision for Dataset-1.  \\n\\nDR Level Precision \\n\\nELM SVM GNB RF DT LR \\n\\nNo DR  0.93  0.82  0.86  0.82  0.82  0.82 \\nMild  0.87  0.42  0.24  0.42  0.28  0.41 \\nModerate  0.87  0.48  0.40  0.47  0.44  0.47 \\nSevere  0.95  0.56  0.47  0.55  0.46  0.52 \\nPDR  0.94  0.61  0.56  0.64  0.61  0.65 \\nAverage  0.91  0.58  0.50  0.58  0.52  0.57  \\n\\nTable 4 \\nClassification performance comparison by F-1Precision for Dataset-1.  \\n\\nDR Level F1-Score \\n\\nELM SVM GNB RF DT LR \\n\\nNo DR  0.95  0.86  0.82  0.86  0.85  0.86 \\nMild  0.77  0.31  0.28  0.30  0.25  0.31 \\nModerate  0.82  0.43  0.45  0.43  0.41  0.43 \\nSevere  0.89  0.39  0.40  0.39  0.36  0.39 \\nPDR  0.91  0.46  0.46  0.47  0.44  0.49 \\nAverage  0.87  0.49  0.48  0.49  0.46  0.49  \\n\\nTable 5 \\nClassification performance comparison by Recall for Dataset-1.  \\n\\nDR Level Recall \\n\\nELM SVM GNB RF DT LR \\n\\nNo DR  0.97  0.91  0.78  0.90  0.87  0.90 \\nMild  0.70  0.24  0.33  0.24  0.23  0.25 \\nModerate  0.78  0.39  0.52  0.40  0.39  0.39 \\nSevere  0.84  0.30  0.35  0.30  0.29  0.31 \\nPDR  0.89  0.37  0.39  0.37  0.34  0.39 \\nAverage  0.83  0.44  0.48  0.44  0.43  0.45  \\n\\nFig. 7.

Whereas the best accuracy obtained \\nby SVM (87.04 %) among other models was almost 10 % lower than the \\nELM model. In the case of medical image analysis, the recall must be \\nmaximized i.e., the affected patient should be identified accurately. \\n\\nThe class-wise ROC is shown in Fig. 9 to assess the ELM’s ability to \\ndistinguish between the DR levels. The estimated ROC of the ELM model \\nfor the APTOS, 2019 dataset was 98.87 %. The ROC of each class was \\nquite good even if the dataset was unbalanced, demonstrating the \\nmodel’s robustness (See Fig. 11). \\n\\nA graphical illustration is shown in Fig. 10 to make the results more \\nlegible and comparable between the two datasets. The suggested \\nframework is compatible in any setting, such as smaller (APTOS, 2019) \\nor larger (Dataset 1) datasets. This was accomplished by employing \\nCLAHE to highlight the lesions. Hence, it is easy for the parallel CNN \\nmodel to extract the most discriminating features and the ELM based on \\ndeep learning mechanism can accurately detected the DR levels. The \\nframework was also straightforward to use as it performed well even \\nwhen dealing with an unbalanced dataset, which is common with real- \\nworld medical data (See Fig. 12). \\n\\n4.3. Comparison with previous works \\n\\nTables 9 and 10 show the classification performance compared with \\nprevious state-of-the-art (SOTA) models for both the datasets. For \\nDataset-1, the proposed framework (PF) was compared with two studies. \\nPratt et al. processed the FIs using color normalization, and developed a \\nCNN with 10 CLs and two FC layers (Pratt et al., 2016). The number of \\nfilters in 10 CLs were 32, 32, 64, 64, 128, 128, 256, 256, 512, and 512, \\nrespectively, and both the FC layers had 1,024 nodes. Apart from these, \\nthey used 5,000 FIs (the shape of the FIs were 512 × 512) for testing and \\nachieved an overall accuracy and sensitivity (recall) of 75 % and 30 %, \\nrespectively. In contrast, Qummar et al. (2019), used five TL models: \\nResnet50, Inceptionv3, Xception, Dense121, and Dense169 for classi-\\nfying DR from the FIs. In addition, they ensemble these five TL models \\nfor final prediction. They also resized the FIs into 512 × 512 and ach-\\nieved an accuracy, recall, precision, and f1-score of 80.8 %, 51.5 %, \\n63.85 %, and 53.74 %, respectively, while testing the model on 5,608 FIs \\nand performing up and down sampling. The proposed PCNN-ELM has \\nonly 8 CLs with 3.6 million parameters, which was quite fewer than the \\nother two works. Again, the contrast of the FIs were enhanced using \\nCLAHE, and for that reason, the lesion was highlighted as shown in \\nFig. 4. Finally, the FIs were resized into 124 × 124 and the framework \\nhas been tested using 5608 FIs and achieved an accuracy of 91.88 %, \\nwhich is 10 % higher than the previous study, and a recall of 83 %, \\nwhich is almost 30 % higher than the previous study.

On the \\ncontrary, each class almost equally contributed to the final classification \\nresult, which validated the handling capability of the unbalanced \\ndataset of the proposed framework. Pratt et al. (2016), showed that their \\nproposed methodology required 0.04 s to classify-one FI. In contrast, the \\nproposed framework required only 0.0009987 s to test the total of 5608 \\nFIs, whereas 2 μs were required for classifying one FI. These two studies \\nreshaped the FIs by 512 × 512, whereas this study used 124 × 124 but \\nstill ensuring a promising result with a calculated AUC of 92.10 % \\n(Qummar et al. achieved an average AUC of 86.8 %) that showed the \\nrobustness of the proposed model. \\n\\nSeveral researchers used the APTOS, 2019 dataset to detect the levels \\nof DR. Table 10 shows the average classification performance of the \\nSOTA models for the APTOS, 2019 dataset as class wise results were not \\navailable. Sikder et al. achieved the highest classification accuracy of \\n94.20 %, and the highest AUC of 97.90 % was achieved by Alyoubi et al. \\n(2021), from the SOTA models (Sikder et al., 2021). In contrast, the \\nproposed framework outperformed all the SOTA models with an \\n\\naccuracy and an AUC of 97.27 % and 98.87 %, respectively. Table 11 \\nshows the comparison of the proposed framework’s performance with \\nthe previous works. From the table, most of the SOTA models employed \\ntransfer learning (TL) models to extract the features and classify the DR \\nfrom the FIs. The TL models have many layers and parameters; for \\ninstance, the VGG16 model has almost 138.3 million parameters, and \\nDenseNet-169 has 169 layers, which are too many. They also required \\nhigh-resolution FIs (512 × 512, 380 × 380, 224 × 224, etc.) to distin-\\nguish the DR levels correctly. \\n\\nIn contrast, the proposed framework only employed six CLs, where \\nfour of them were run in parallel, which was considered a single CL. \\nHence, there were total eight layers, including four CLs, two FC layers, \\nand three from the ELM. The total parameters of the proposed frame-\\nwork are almost 3.6 million, including both the parallel CNN and ELM \\nmodel parameters that validated the lightweight capability of the CNN. \\nThis framework required an image size of 124 × 124, which was another \\nobjective of this study to detect DR levels using low-resolution FIs. \\nTable 11 shows that the proposed framework has the lowest number of \\nparameters and layers, which could be the main reason for shorter \\nprocessing time. \\n\\nFrom the above comparison, it was concluded that the proposed \\nframework could classify the levels of DR accurately with lower pa-\\nrameters, layers, low-resolution FIs, and relatively shorter time. It was \\nalso revealed that the framework is capable of adapting to any dataset \\nenvironment, small or large, balanced or imbalanced and that classi-\\nfying a FI requires only 2 μs seconds, allowing for real-time patient \\nfeedback. \\n\\nIn fact, the diabetic retinopathy datasets used in this study were \\nhighly imbalanced particularly for the multiclass classification due to \\nthe unavailability of the PDR images. Since in real life consideration, the \\nnumber of PDR patients are not many, and most datasets contain small \\nportion of PDR images with respect to the other classes. Since the dataset \\nwas fairly imbalanced, some researchers used data augmentation and \\nother techniques (adding weight to the poorly detected class, up sam-\\npling, down sampling) to improve the classification performance (Pratt \\net al., 2016; Dondeti. al., 2020). However, the results were not better \\nthan the findings obtained by the proposed framework. Using data \\naugmentation, more data can be produced, but it needs additional time \\nfor processing. Most studies, while using these two imbalanced datasets, \\nreported results without any data balancing (Nahiduzzaman et al., \\n2021a,b; Pratt et al., 2016; Dondeti. al., 2020; Bodapati et al., 2020; \\nBodapati et al., 2021). Apart from these, the results presented for \\nDataset-1 in Table 4 to Table 6, it was observed that the precision, recall \\nand f1-score of PDR images were 0.94, 0.91 and 0.89 respectively which \\nwere quite satisfactory. Though there were a smaller number of PDR \\nimages, but the classification results were similar to the normal images \\n(precision, f1-score and recall of No DR images are 0.93, 0.97 and 0.95 \\nrespectively). Again, similar observations were made for the APTOS, \\n2019 dataset. In addition, from Fig. 8, it was found that the class wise \\nROC of PDR was 97.73 % whereases for No DR it was 94.51 % in the case \\nof Dataset-1. Therefore, it can be concluded that without implementing \\nany data augmentation technique, the proposed CNN-ELM model \\ndetected the DR accurately without producing any biased results due to \\n\\nTable 9 \\nClass-wise classification performance of the proposed framework (PF) compared with the previous studies for the Dataset-1.  \\n\\nLevel/ \\nRef.

Conclusion \\n\\nThis study proposed a novel framework to enable fast and accurate \\ndetection of the levels of DR from the FIs, which can aid diabetic patients \\nin preventing or delaying vision loss. CLAHE was adopted to make the \\nlesson clear so that a CNN model can easily extract the most discrimi-\\nnating features. 120 features were extracted using a lightweight parallel \\nCNN to reduce processing time and complexity. Finally, these features \\nwere standardized and fit into the ELM model to adequately distinguish \\nthe different levels of the DR. The proposed framework exhibited a \\npromising result in the cases of 34,984 (Dataset-1) and 3,662 (APTOS, \\n2019) FI datasets with not only higher classification performance but \\nalso lowering the parameters, layers, and processing time significantly. \\nThe framework also outperformed the existing SOTA models for both the \\ndatasets. The proposed model can accurately detect the severity degree \\nof the DR earlier on, hence reducing vision loss of the patients and saving \\nvaluable time of the medical practitioners. \\n\\nCRediT authorship contribution statement \\n\\nMd.

O\\n\\nKeywords:\\nStock market forecasting\\nCOVID-19 pandemic\\nMulti-task learning\\nFeature fusion\\nK-nearest neighbor classifier\\n\\nA B S T R A C T\\n\\nThe sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has dramatically altered the state of the global economy, and the stock\\nmarket has become more volatile and even fallen sharply as a result of its negative impact, heightening\\ninvestors’ apprehension regarding the correlation between unexpected events and stock market volatility.\\nAdditionally, internal and external characteristics coexist in the stock market. Existing research has struggled\\nto extract more effective stock market features during the COVID-19 outbreak using a single time-series neural\\nnetwork model. This paper presents a framework for multitasking learning-based stock market forecasting\\n(COVID-19-MLSF), which can extract the internal and external features of the stock market and their\\nrelationships effectively during COVID-19.The innovation comprises three components: designing a new market\\nsentiment index (NMSI) and COVID-19 index to represent the external characteristics of the stock market\\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides, it introduces a multi-task learning framework to extract global and\\nlocal features of the stock market. Moreover, a temporal convolutional neural network with a multi-scale\\nattention mechanism is designed (MA-TCN) alongside a Multi-View Convolutional-Bidirectional Recurrent\\nNeural Network with Temporal Attention (MVCNN-BiLSTM-Att), adjusting the model to account for the\\nchanging status of COVID-19 and its impact on the stock market. Experiments indicate that our model achieves\\nsuperior performance both in terms of predicting the accuracy of the China CSI 300 Index during the COVID-19\\nperiod and in terms of sing market trading.\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nAs the stock market and artificial intelligence technology develop\\nrapidly, a new generation of quantitative trading tools on the basis of\\nmachine learning has performed well in stock prediction tasks (Giudici,\\nPolinesi, & Spelta, 2022; Ma, Zhao, Guo, Li, & Zhang, 2022; Shah,\\nBhatt, & Shah, 2022; Yan et al., 2020), and numerous quantitative stock\\ntrading researchers have gained huge profits from the stock market,\\nwhich is prospering. Besides, COVID-19 has had a huge impact on\\nthe stock market, and Fig. 1 demonstrates a time series chart of the\\nclosing prices of the five major global stock indexes from January 2019\\nto May 2020. Consequently, the global stock market has experienced\\na significant decline, as is evident. The poor handling mechanism of\\nmost stock market forecasting models for unforeseen events limits the\\npredictive power of the models during this period, which has prompted\\nthe investigation of stock market forecasting models that can handle\\nCOVID-19 pandemic events (Ronaghi, Salimibeni, Naderkhani, & Mo-\\nhammadi, 2022; Štifanić et al., 2020). Based on this, we conducted\\n\\n∗ Corresponding author.\\nE-mail addresses: yuanchenxun@mail.sdu.edu.cn (C. Yuan), xiangma@mail.sdu.edu.cn (X. Ma), hua.wang@ldu.edu.cn (H.

Yuan et al.\\nFig. 1. Time-series chart of the closing prices of the five major global stock indexes between 2019.01 and 2020.05 (The closing price is normalized to the maximum and minimum).\\navailable in textual information, and the fact that most of the textual\\ninformation contains personal subjective opinions and with varying\\nquality. This is particularly true during unpredictable occurrences such\\nas the COVID-19 pandemic. Ahelegbey, Cerchiello, and Scaramozzino\\n(2022) have confirmed in recent literature that COVID-19 can sig-\\nnificantly affect financial markets, and using multi-characteristic data\\n(such as market and sentiment data) to study the impact of COVID-19\\non different industries, provides more effective evidence for studying\\nthe impact of COVID-19 on the stock market. In some studies, Twitter\\ncomments during COVID-19 (Ronaghi et al., 2022) and confirmed\\nCOVID-19 cases (Štifanić et al., 2020) have been employed to predict\\nthe stock market with positive results. Nonetheless, the polarity of\\nthe sentiment of Twitter comments is challenging to determine, either\\nthrough manual annotation or natural language processing models.\\nFurthermore, since different textual data, namely, news and stock re-\\nviews are intermingled with the stock market’s short-term or long-term\\neffects, it is difficult to classify and analyze the text data information.\\nConsequently, we must identify other predictability-enhancing charac-\\nteristics that are more efficient. It has been confirmed in some literature\\nthat Chinese stock market has features such as fast response to national\\npolicy regulations and parallel socioeconomic development with stock\\nmarket (Los & Yu, 2008; Wang, 2010), therefore, macroeconomic data\\ndoes have a longer-term impact on the stock market and can reflect\\nthe long-term market trend in advance, in comparison with stock\\ncommentaries or textual information. Additionally, due to the decrease\\nin COVID-19 lethality, the growing number of cured cases, as well\\nas the gradual development of new foreign trade policies in distinct\\ncountries, which have substantially aided the economic recovery it has\\nbecome tough to reflect the development status of COVID-19 and the\\nimpact on the stock market employing only COVID-19 confirmed cases.\\nIn accordance to our study, the number of cured COVID-19 cases, the\\nsearch volume of the epidemic in Baidu’s index, and the media informa-\\ntion statistics all reflect COVID-19’s changing status to distinct degrees.\\n2\\n\\nThus, we can utilize principal component analysis to downscale the\\naforementioned indicators and investigate the mechanism and mode of\\ninfluence of an unexpected event including such COVID-19 on stock\\nprice fluctuations.\\n\\nOn the other hand, time-series prediction models including re-\\ncurrent neural networks represented by long and short-term mem-\\nory neural networks (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997), gated re-\\ncurrent units (Cho et al., 2014), and temporal convolutional neural\\nnetworks (Bai, Kolter, & Koltun, 2018) have become acknowledged as\\nsuperior deep learning models in time-series analysis (Yan et al., 2020).\\nNonetheless, Recent studies have indicated that it has been challenging\\nto extract more effective data with the aid of RNNs (Rezaei, Faaljou, &\\nMansourfar, 2021; Yan et al., 2020). Although the causal convolution\\nstructure proposed by TCN alleviates the issue arising from RNN, the\\ntraditional TCN is insensitive to the essential information in long time\\nseries. Additionally, this class of single-task prediction models lacks\\nhigh-quality feature learning capabilities when dealing with nonlinear,\\nhighly noisy stock price series, particularly on the condition that there\\nare multiple input sources and they may overlap more noise in the\\ndata, increasing the highly noisy nature of the data (Ko et al., 2021).\\nThe framework for multitask learning is an effective solution. Multi-\\ntask learning refers to learning multiple related tasks at the same\\ntime, allowing these tasks to share knowledge in the learning process,\\nand applying the correlation between multiple tasks to enhance the\\nperformance and generalization ability of the model in the task, which\\ncan serve a limited data enhancement function, and has been widely\\nadopted and demonstrated excellent results in natural language pro-\\ncessing (Collobert & Weston, 2008), computer vision (Girshick, 2015).\\nExisting applications of multi-task learning in the stock market (Li,\\nSong, & Tao, 2019; Ma & Tan, 2020, 2022; Zhang, Wu, & Li, 2022)\\nhave also largely enhanced the feature extraction capability of the\\nmodels, and yet some current work (Li et al., 2019; Ma & Tan, 2020;\\nMootha, Sridhar, Seetharaman, & Chitrakala, 2020; Zhang et al., 2022)\\n\\n\\n\\nExpert Systems With Applications 217 (2023) 119549C. Yuan et al.\\nonly learns the stock price series to varying degrees. Consequently,\\nthe extracted individual features cannot adequately describe the state\\nof the stock market. Many factors affect the rise and fall of stocks,\\nand these factors usually do not exist in isolation, and stock prices\\nare formed in such intertwined effects, which causes the multi-source\\nnature of stock data, and the predominant advantage of multi-task\\nlearning, especially multi-task learning framework on the basis of soft\\nsharing mechanism (Ma & Tan, 2022) is the capacity to learn diverse\\ndata sources by completing a variety of subtasks.\\n\\nFor the purpose of coping with the impact of stock price fluctuations\\ncaused by emergencies such as COVID-19 on stock market forecasting\\nmodels. This paper uses the principal component analysis method to\\nconstruct a New Market Sentiment Index (NMSI) owing to macroeco-\\nnomic data and a COVID-19 index reflecting the development status\\nof COVID-19 in China to characterize the external feature of the stock\\nmarket in times of emergencies. We subsequently propose a multi-\\ntask learning-based forecasting model for COVID-19-MLSF, and the\\nmodel framework is indicated in Fig. 2. In this model, we introduced\\nthe framework of multi-task learning and establish two forecasting\\nsubtasks whilst also combining the constructed external features of\\nthe stock market (NMSI and COVID-19 Index) with the low-frequency\\nand high-frequency signals decomposed by stock price correspondingly.\\nBesides, the subtasks extract global and local features of the stock\\nprice series, thereby effectively solving the problem of tough feature\\nextraction and miscellaneous internal features of the stock price series.\\nDue to the fact that multi-task learning reduces the impact of local\\nparameters on the global and reduces overfitting of the main task, the\\nmain task’s predictive ability is significantly enhanced. In addition, this\\npaper adds attention mechanisms to dissimilar causal convolutional\\nlayers of TCNs, and the newly designed temporal convolutional neural\\nnetwork (MA-TCN) with multi-scale attention mechanism makes TCNs\\nmore sensitive to important features. Moreover, to address the issue\\nthat recurrent neural networks have a propensity to forget sequence\\nfeatures, this paper proposes a convolutional-bi-directional recurrent\\ncombining multiview convolutional neural network and temporal at-\\ntention mechanism(MVCNN-BiLSTM-Att). In comparison with a single\\nrecurrent neural network, the feature extraction and memory capabili-\\nties of the network are improved. Experiments further reveal that our\\nmodel accomplishes superior performance in predicting the China CSI\\n300 index and high returns on the bear market state during COVID-19.\\n\\nThe following are the major contributions of this paper:\\n\\n• A new market sentiment index (NMSI) and COVID-19 index are\\nconstructed to reflect the external features of the stock market,\\nintroducing a novel method for studying the effects of unforeseen\\nevents, namely, COVID-19 on stock price volatility.\\n\\n• Multitask learning forecasting framework is designed to handle\\nmultiple data sources of the stock market. Moreover, the decom-\\nposed stock price series and the constructed external features of\\nthe stock market are established as separate prediction subtasks,\\nwhich alleviate the issue of complex features mingling in stock\\nprice data and likewise enhance the ability to make the neural\\nnetwork feature extraction module more capable of extracting\\neffective features.\\n\\n• Design a Multi-scale attention mechanism temporal convolu-\\ntional neural network (MA-TCN), which effectively solves the\\ntraditional TCN’s insensitivity to long sequences of significant\\ninformation and thus calculates the weight parameters of distinct\\nfeature information better. Furthermore, design a multi-view\\nconvolutional-bi-directional recurrent neural network (MVCNN-\\nBiLSTM-Att) to model how the COVID-19 state affects stock\\nmarket volatility.\\n\\nThe remaining sections are organized as follows: Section 2 reviews\\nsome literature and novel methods related to this paper. Subsequently,\\nSection 3 describes how the Market Sentiment Index (NMSI) and the\\n3\\n\\nCOVID-19 Index are constructed. Section 4 presents the three task\\nmodules of the COVID-19-MLSF. Except for that, Section 5 presents ex-\\nperimental demonstrations, including comparison and ablation experi-\\nments as well as hyperparametric sensitivity tests. Ultimately, Section 6\\nconcludes the entire paper and suggests future works.\\n\\n2. Review of literature\\n\\nIn the last decade, stock market forecasting has gained a great deal\\nof attention from financiers and computer scientists due to its unique\\nfeatures and wide range of potential applications.\\n\\n2.1. Prediction based on machine learning and multi-task learning\\n\\nRecurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their derivatives, long and\\nshort-term memory neural networks (LSTMs) and memory recurrent\\nunits (GRUs), have been proposed as alternative methods for extracting\\nnonlinearity from stock price series in traditional time series mod-\\nels (Fu, Zhang, & Li, 2016; Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997). In spite of\\nthis, these mentioned networks has serious problems, such as gradient\\ndisappearance and explosion, which adversely affect stock predictions\\nfor long time series. Bi-directional recurrent neural networks (Bi-RNN),\\nsuch as the bi-directional long-term memory networks (Bi-LSTM), are\\nbetter suited to predicting long- and short-term trends in stock data\\nsince they can capture information about both the past and future of the\\ndata (Althelaya, El-Alfy, & Mohammed, 2018; Siami-Namini, Tavakoli,\\n& Namin, 2019; Yang & Wang, 2022). In addition to recurrent neural\\nnetworks, temporal convolutional neural networks (TCNs) have been\\nshown to outperform RNNs in a number of tasks (Bai et al., 2018;\\nCheng et al., 2021; Dai, An, & Long, 2022). However, TCNs are neither\\nsensitive to the important information contained in the sequences nor\\nto effectively extract it. The attention mechanism give new solution\\nof the problem of feature attention in long-term sequences. Base on\\nthis process, recurrent neural networks incorporating the attention\\nmechanism are widely used to predict stock prices. An example would\\nbe the two-stage attention recurrent neural network model (DA-RNN)\\nproposed by Qin et al. (2017). This model through input attention\\nmechanism to capture spatial features, while temporal features, and get\\nbetter results of NASDAQ prediction.\\n\\nIt is common for researchers to resolve the time series data before\\ninputting the model using the signal decomposition method (Lah-\\nmiri, 2016a; Lin, Lin, & Cao, 2021; Ma, Li, Zhou, & Zhang, 2021;\\nRezaei et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2020), with representative methods\\nincluding Fourier transform (FT), wavelet transform (WT), empirical\\nmode decomposition (EMD), ensemble empirical mode decomposition\\n(EEMD), variable mode decomposition (VMD), etc. By decomposing\\nthe complex and high-noise financial time series into semaphores of\\ndifferent frequencies, it is possible to achieve a faster convergence\\nduring deep neural network learning and avoid overfitting. What is\\nmore, it is possible to separate the different valid information in the\\nstock sequence. Nevertheless, the decomposition methods used in the\\naforementioned literatures need to decompose all data once, which\\nmeans there may be leakage of future data, so that the prediction\\nresults will be prospectively biased. Liu, Ma, Li, Li, and Zhang (2022)\\ndecomposed the data selected through the sliding window in order to\\nsolve the problem of future data leaks, and stock price data used in this\\npaper were also decomposed in this manner.\\n\\nWith the development of deep learning, deep multitasking learning\\nhas become one of the important subfields. Multi-task learning is to\\nshare the features extracted from different tasks by performing multiple\\nprediction tasks at the same time. Multi-task learning not only has bet-\\nter feature extraction ability than a single model, but also has stronger\\ngeneralization ability, and has been widely used in the prediction of\\nstock data (Li et al., 2019; Ma & Tan, 2020, 2022; Zhang et al., 2022).\\nMa and Tan (2020) added attention mechanism to multitask learning\\n\\nto learn shared and private features from different tasks, and Zhang\\n\\n\\n\\nExpert Systems With Applications 217 (2023) 119549C. Yuan et al.\\nFig. 2. COVID19-MLSF Framework.\\net al. (2022) proposed an online multitask learning method with OMTL-\\nLSSVR, which innovatively introduced online learning into multitask\\nlearning and significantly improved the prediction accuracy of the\\ncurrent task with continuously updated data. Nevertheless, entering\\nthe sequence of stock price into different neural network models and\\nextracting features is the essence of the work. Then we complete the\\nprediction after exchange these features. Because the use of stock\\nprice series only may result in similar features being extracted across\\ndifferent tasks, does not fully utilize the advantages of the multitask\\nlearning framework in handling multi-source data.\\n\\n2.2. Prediction based on multiple features of the stock market\\n\\nAs the stock market becomes more prosperous, researchers are\\nlooking for more features to assist in market forecasting. It is easiest\\nto use technical indicators, such as MA, MACD, RSI, etc., derived\\nfrom stock prices, to assist in stock forecasting. These indicators are\\nwidely used because they can reflect long and short-term trends as well\\nas phenomena such as overbought and oversold conditions (Agrawal,\\nKhan, & Shukla, 2019; Gao & Chai, 2018). To alleviate the delaying\\nprediction causing by single stock data, Baker and Wurgler (2006,\\n2007) used other data, such as macroeconomic data, to construct the\\nBW sentiment indicators which reflect external information about the\\nstock market. Additionally, multi-feature fusion forecasting is primarily\\nbased on news and investor sentiment; Jing et al. (2021) used stock\\nforum text data from Oriental Fortune for sentiment analysis and CNN\\nmodel for classification through Chinese sentiment corpus (ChnSen-\\ntiCorp), combined with stock technical indicator information, then\\nfinally predicted by LSTM network, and obtained a low mean absolute\\npercentage error; Zhang et al. (2018) performed a detailed analysis of\\nthe historical comments of experts in stock reviews and proposed a\\nstrategy to find a good stock reviewer by combining the trend of stock\\nprice changes and the opinion polarity (i.e., bullish or bearish) of stock\\nreviewers to obtain high return returns in a backtest experiment. Hu,\\nLiu, Bian, Liu, and Liu (2018) used economic news data to link specific\\nstocks to news constructed a daily stock news corpus by linking it\\nwith stock price information, and then added stock price information\\nto design a HAN hybrid network (a two-way GRU network incorpo-\\nrating Attention), which significantly improved annualized returns in\\nreal stock market simulations; with the negative impact of COVID-\\n19 globally, some researchers have combined different perspectives\\non the COVID-19 and stock market linkages (Ronaghi et al., 2022;\\nŠtifanić et al., 2020). Ronaghi et al. (2022) extracted relevant data\\n4\\n\\nabout COVID-19 from Twitter comments to build a COVID19-PRIMO\\nTwitter dataset and then had stock prices for prediction, achieving a\\nhigh accuracy rate. In order to effectively avoid the problem of data\\ndimensional disaster, principal component analysis, as an important\\ndimensionality reduction method in the data preprocessing stage, has\\nshown good effectiveness in stock market prediction (Chen & Hao,\\n2018; Yan et al., 2020; Yue, Zhou, & Yuan, 2021; Zheng & He, 2021).\\n\\n3. Prepare work\\n\\nThis section describes how China’s Market Sentiment Index (NMSI)\\nand COVID-19 Index are constructed, showing their relationship with\\nthe CSI 300 Index. The variational modal sliding window decomposi-\\ntion method used in the data pre-processing stage is also introduced.\\n\\n3.1. New market sentiment index\\n\\nAs for choosing the original data used to construct the market\\nsentiment index, in order to make the index highly similar(Pearson\\ncorrelation coefficient)to CSI 300 (Gong, Zhang, Wang, & Wang, 2022;\\nYi & Mao, 2009), by continuously updating different basic data and\\ncalculating the similarity, 11 groups of basic data are selected as the\\nbasic data to create the index. Using neural networks to deal with\\nthem directly will result in redundancy of information. Therefore, we\\nreduced dimensionality using principal component analysis. There is no\\nneed to denoise the raw data and remove outliers before doing so. This\\nis due to the fact that these data are actual daily changes in market\\nconditions and COVID-19. Noise reduction, particularly removing out-\\nliers, will decrease the correlation between the constructed index and\\nthe CSI 300 Index. Below is a brief description of what they mean.\\n\\nFund Discount Rate (DCEF): The extent to which the market price\\nof a closed-end fund is below the net asset value.\\n\\nNumber of Initial Public Offerings (NIPO): The first time a com-\\npany sells its shares to the public.\\n\\nRevenue on the first day of IPO (RIPO): The yield on the first day\\na company sells its shares to the public for the first time.\\n\\nNumber of New Accounts (NA): The number of new natural\\npersons investing, i.e. the number of new stockholders per month.\\n\\nNumber of New Investors (NewInvestors): The number of in-\\nvestors at the end of the current period minus the number of investors\\nat the end of the previous period (the number of investors at the end\\nof the period refers to the number of one-code accounts holding un-\\ncancelled, dormant A shares, B shares, credit accounts, and derivative\\ncontract accounts)\\n\\n\\n\\nExpert Systems With Applications 217 (2023) 119549C. Yuan et al.\\nFig. 3. NMSI and CSI 300 Trends.\\nConsumer Confidence Index (CCI): An indicator of the strength\\nof consumer confidence, a comprehensive reflection and quantification\\nof consumers’ evaluation of the current economic situation and their\\nsubjective feelings about the economic outlook, income levels, income\\nexpectations and the psychological state of consumption, and a leading\\nindicator for forecasting economic trends and consumption tendencies.\\n\\nConsumer Price Index (CPI): It is a relative number reflecting the\\ntrend and degree of price changes of consumer goods and services\\npurchased by urban and rural residents during a certain period of time.\\n\\nInvestor Confidence Index (ICI): The change in investment psy-\\nchology and expectations of investors in the securities market under\\nthe current economic and market environment.\\n\\nSocial Financing Scale (AFRE): Social financing scale refers to\\nthe total amount of all funds obtained by the real economy from the\\nfinancial system in a certain period of time. It reflects the relationship\\nbetween finance and economy, as well as the aggregate indicator of\\nfinancial support to the real economy.\\n\\nTurnover Rate: It refers to the frequency of stocks changing hands\\nin the market within a certain period of time, and is one of the\\nindicators reflecting the strength of stock liquidity.\\n\\nPE ratio: PE ratio is the ratio of stock price divided by earnings per\\nshare, and can be used as one of the indicators to assess whether the\\nstock price level is reasonable.\\n\\nFor the above 11 indicators, most of them only provide monthly\\ndata because macroeconomic data indicators such as consumer confi-\\ndence index and social financing scale are a level value to reflect a\\ncertain aspect of society in the current period, and their daily data have\\nno specific reference significance. For a better correspondence with\\nother daily data such as turnover rate and P/E ratio, and to facilitate the\\ndimensionality reduction process, we first transform the monthly data\\ninto daily data using linear interpolation and eliminate non-trading\\ndays’ data to ensure the overall trend of data distribution remained\\nunchanged and achieve the data dimensionality correspondence. Here,\\nwe obtain the raw data matrix 𝛽 of the market sentiment index (where\\n𝑋, 𝑌 ... 𝑍 represent the 11 raw data and m denotes the number of rows),\\nas shown in Eq. (1).\\n\\n𝛽 =\\n\\n⎡\\n\\n⎢\\n\\n⎢\\n\\n⎢\\n\\n⎢\\n\\nX1 Y1 Z1\\nX2 Y2 ⋯ Z2\\n\\n⋮ ⋱ ⋮\\n\\n⎤\\n\\n⎥\\n\\n⎥\\n\\n⎥\\n\\n⎥\\n\\n(1)\\n5\\n\\n⎣\\n\\nX𝑚 Y𝑚 ⋯ Z𝑚 ⎦\\nAmong the many indicators mentioned above, there are many mi-\\ncro and macro factors that affect the stock market, which are not\\nindependent of each other. The use of neural network directly will\\ncause information redundancy, so we use principal component analysis\\nto reduce the dimensions. The specific steps are as follows. First,\\nthe original data matrix 𝛽 is normalized using Eq. (2) to obtain the\\nnormalization matrix 𝑆.\\n\\n𝑆𝑖𝑗 =\\n𝑥𝑖𝑗 − �̄�𝑗\\n\\n𝜎𝑗\\n, 𝑖 = 1, 2,… , 𝑚; 𝑗 = 1, 2,… , 𝑝 (2)\\n\\nwhere 𝑝 denotes the number of columns, 𝑥𝑖𝑗 denotes the data matrix\\n𝛽 values, and �̄�𝑗 , 𝜎𝑗 denote the mean and standard deviation of each\\ncomponent 𝑗.\\n\\nThen the initial eigenvalues of the matrix Z were extracted using\\nEq. (3).\\n|\\n\\n|\\n\\n|\\n\\n𝑅 − 𝜆𝑗𝐼\\n|\\n\\n|\\n\\n|\\n\\n= 0 (3)\\n\\nwhere 𝑅 denotes the correlation coefficient matrix of matrix 𝑆, and 𝑝\\neigenvalues 𝜆𝑗 are obtained. The principal components with eigenval-\\nues greater than 1 are selected, and the score coefficient matrix A𝑔𝑗 (𝑔\\nis the number of principal components with eigenvalues greater than 1)\\nand each principal component value 𝑌𝑔 are calculated for the original\\ndata, and then the final new market sentiment index (NMSI) 𝑀𝑚 is\\ncalculated.\\n\\nA𝑔𝑗 = U𝑔 ∗\\n√\\n\\n𝑌𝑔 (4)\\n\\n𝑌𝑔 =\\n∑\\n\\n(\\n\\nA𝑔𝑗 ∗ 𝛽\\n)\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n𝑀𝑚 =\\n∑\\n\\n(\\n\\n𝑌𝑔 ∗ 𝜆𝑔\\n)\\n\\n(6)\\n\\nwhere U𝑔 is the loading of the principal component, 𝑌𝑔 represents\\nthe eigenvalue corresponding to each principal component, 𝑌𝑔 repre-\\nsents the 𝑔th principal component, and 𝜆𝑔 represents the eigenvalue\\ncorresponding to the 𝑔th principal component.\\n\\nFig. 3 illustrates the relationship between our constructed New\\nMarket Sentiment Index (NMSI) and the CSI 300 Index, and it can be\\nobserved that the trend of the constructed Market Sentiment Index is\\nbasically in line with the trend of the CSI 300 Index. In particular, the\\nNMSI can reflect the trend of the CSI 300 index in advance, such as at\\n\\n\\n\\nExpert Systems With Applications 217 (2023) 119549C.

NMSI does not use the stock price data,\\nut can reflect the overall market trend, so NMSI is an important global\\nxternal feature of the stock market.\\n\\n.2. COVID-19 index\\n\\nAlthough the COVID-19 confirmed case data can reflect the changes\\nf COVID-19, it still reflects the status of COVID-19 in an incomplete\\nay. The data used to construct the COVID-19 Index are daily COVID-\\n9 confirmed cases, new deaths, new cures, cumulative confirmed\\nases, cumulative deaths, cumulative cures, and the number of key-\\nords ‘‘epidemic’’ in Baidu search and Baidu information in China. By\\nbserving the changes of COVID-19 and stock market related data and\\nombining with news reports, we further summarize the mechanism\\nnd influence of COVID-19 on the stock market. According to our\\nnalysis, when the number of confirmed cases and deaths and the topic\\nf ‘‘COVID-19’’ in online information increases, investors’ investment\\nentiment is pessimistic, and the stock market will decline; When\\nhe topic of ‘‘COVID-19’’ decreases and the number of cured cases\\nncreases, investors’ investment sentiment is optimistic, and the stock\\narket will rise. Data also supports the above viewpoint, such as the\\n\\nhanghai and Shenzhen 300 index rose nearly 5.8% after the Chinese\\novernment announced the free universal and widespread vaccination\\nf the new crown vaccine on December 31, 2020. Another example is\\nhe World Health Organization (WHO) named the ‘‘Omicron’’ COVID-\\n9 variant in November 2021 and confirmed a significant increase in\\nhe transmissibility of COVID-19, major stock markets in Europe and\\nhe US fell across the board, with all three major US stock indexes\\nown more than 2%. Among them, the Dow Jones (DJI) fell 2.53%,\\nhe biggest drop of the year, while the Nasdaq (IXIC) and the S&P\\n00 (S&P500) fell 2.23% and 2.27%, respectively. In Europe, the major\\nndexes also suffered heavy losses, with Germany’s DAX closing down\\n.15%, the largest one-day drop since 2021, and France’s CAC 40 and\\nhe UK’s FTSE 100 down 4.75% and 3.64%, respectively; in the Chinese\\narket, the CSI 300 index fell 1.41% and the SSE index fell 1.47%.\\n\\nFurther, we use data on stock price volatility to more visually\\nonfirm the impact of COVID-19 on the stock market. As shown in\\nig. 4, the relationship between monthly volatility and COVID-19 for\\nhe CSI 300 index for 2019–2021 is demonstrated. When there are\\noncentrated outbreaks of COVID-19, such as between February–March\\n020, February 2021 and July–August 2021, stock market volatility is\\nignificantly high in that month or adjacent months, indicating that\\nhe occurrence of COVID-19 exacerbates the volatile state of the stock\\narket.\\n\\nThe method and procedure for constructing the COVID-19 Index\\nre consistent with Section 3.1, and we omit the construction process\\nere. For subsequent integration with the stock price series features,\\nhe COVID-19 Index for the period when COVID-19 did not occur is set\\no 0. In this way, the COVID-19 Index is expanded to a sequence 𝐶𝑚 of\\nhe same length as the original stock price series.

Sliding window-VMD\\n\\nVariational modal sliding window decomposition is used to de-\\ncompose the stock price series with different frequency components.\\nNumerous studies (Lahmiri, 2016b; Wu & Lin, 2019) have shown that\\nvariational modal decomposition (VMD) solves the serious endpoint\\neffects and modal component mixing problems that occur in empirical\\nmodal decomposition, and has been widely used in biomedical signal\\nprocessing (Lahmiri, 2014), time series prediction (Lahmiri, 2016b),\\nmechanical fault diagnosis (Li, Liu, Wu, & Chen, 2020), and other\\nfields. Due to the non-recursive signal processing method, VMD can\\ndetermine the number of mode decompositions according to the actual\\nsituation. Therefore, VMD is used to decompose the stock series into\\nlow-frequency and high-frequency signal sequences by adjusting to the\\nmost appropriate number of decompositions.\\n\\nFor the VMD decomposition algorithm, the essence of the decompo-\\nsition process is the variational problem. The existing VMD decompo-\\nsition method decomposes the stock sequence 𝑋(𝑚) =\\n\\n[\\n\\n𝑥1, 𝑥2, 𝑥3 … 𝑥𝑚\\n]\\n\\n.\\n\\nmin\\n𝜔𝑘 ,𝑉𝑘)\\n\\n{ 𝑛\\n∑\\n\\n𝑘=1\\n\\n‖\\n\\n‖\\n\\n‖\\n\\n𝜕𝑚\\n[\\n\\n(𝛿(𝑚) + 𝑗∕𝜋𝑚) ∗ 𝑉𝑘(𝑚)\\n]\\n\\n𝑒−𝑗𝜔𝑖𝑚‖\\n‖\\n\\n‖\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n}\\n\\n𝑛\\n∑\\n\\n𝑘=1\\n𝑉𝑘 = 𝑋(𝑚)\\n\\n(8)\\n\\nwhere 𝑚 denotes each moment of the sequence, 𝑋(𝑚) is the original\\nequence of stock prices, 𝑘 is the number of modes, 𝛿(𝑚) is the Dirichlet\\nunction, ∗ denotes the convolution, 𝑗 =\\n\\n√\\n\\n−1, and 𝜕𝑚 is the partial\\nderivative. After decomposition, 𝑘 discrete modes are obtained, and\\nthe component of each mode 𝑘 is 𝑉𝑘, and each 𝑉𝑘 is concentrated\\naround the center frequency 𝜔𝑘 of each eigenmodal function compo-\\nnent. The components thus decomposed are a set of vector values;\\nfor example, the decomposition yields a low-frequency sequence that\\ncan be expressed as 𝑉𝑘=1 =\\n\\n[\\n\\n𝐿1, 𝐿2, 𝐿3 …𝐿𝑚\\n]\\n\\n.

Summary\\n\\nThe non-stationary signal is decomposed using the decomposition\\nethod, and the relevant frequency signal is selected for analysis to\\n\\nxtract the corresponding features. This paper uses the VMD method\\no decompose stock price series into low-frequency signals and high-\\nrequency signals. According to the theory of VMD decomposition\\nethod, the low-frequency signal reflects the long-term trend, and the\\nigh-frequency signal reflects the short-term fluctuations. From the\\nalculation methods of the market sentiment index(Section 3.1) and\\nechnical indicators, we can see that these two types of data are similar\\no low-frequency signals, reflecting the medium and long-term trend\\nharacteristics of stock price changes. We calculated the correlation of\\now-frequency signals, market sentiment index and technical indicators,\\ns shown in Table 3. The low-frequency signal has a large correlation\\noefficient with the market sentiment index and the technical indicator\\nA. It can be seen that it is feasible to combine the three to extract\\n\\nlobal features. In the same way, the daily COVID-19 index has a\\norresponding impact on the stock market, as the variables that com-\\nose it change daily. As an example, when COVID-19 cases increased\\nignificantly, the stock market fell significantly. Therefore, COVID-19\\nan be used as a data feature supplement for high-frequency signals,\\nnd the designed neural network can be used to extract the features of\\n8\\n\\ntock price and COVID-19 index.\\nTable 3\\nDemonstration of correlation.\\n\\nNMSI MA\\n\\nLow frequency signal 0.85 0.94\\n\\n4. Methodology\\n\\nThe COVID19-MLSF framework in this paper mainly consists of a\\nglobal feature extraction module (subtask 1), a local feature extraction\\nmodule (subtask 2), and a prediction result output module (main task).\\nThe global feature extraction module combines low-frequency signals,\\ntechnical indicators, and NMSI to produce a feature matrix that reflects\\nthe long-term trends in the stock market, and the long-term trend\\nfeatures of the stock market are extracted using a newly designed\\nmulti-scale attention mechanism of the temporal convolutional neural\\nnetwork (MA-TCN); The MA-TCN uses a multi-layered attention mech-\\nanism that makes the TCN more responsive to important features. In\\nthe local feature extraction module, the high-frequency signals that\\nreflect the short-term fluctuations of stock series and the constructed\\nCOVID-19 Index are jointly modeled to build a feature matrix that\\nreflects the short-term fluctuations of the stock market, and the short-\\nterm fluctuations in the stock market, and these short-term fluctuation\\nare extracted by our designed, multi-view convolutional-bidirectional\\nrecurrent neural network with temporal attention (MVCNN-BiLSTM-\\nAtt). The MVCNN-BiLSTM-Att employs multiple convolutional neural\\nnetworks with different sensory fields, and incorporates a temporal\\nattention mechanism in the recurrent neural network, which not only\\nenhances the local feature extraction capability of the model, but also\\nfocuses on capturing the impact of the changing COVID-19 state on\\nstock market volatility. In the above two modules, both TCN and\\nBiLSTM structures are non-parametric machine learning models, which\\nallow to combine continuous data (such as market data) with categor-\\nical ones(such as COVID-19 data). Finally, the features extracted from\\nthe two subtask modules and stock price sequences are fed into a KNN\\nmodel for stock market trend prediction.\\n\\n4.1. Subtasks1:Global feature extraction module\\n\\nIn the subtask 1 module, the low-frequency sequence 𝑉𝑚1, the\\nmarket sentiment indicator sequence 𝑀𝑚 and the stock price technical\\nindicator sequence 𝑇𝑚 3-dimensional feature sequence obtained by\\ndecomposing the stock price sequence, their combination forms a multi-\\ndimensional feature matrix 𝐻\\n\\n[\\n\\n𝑉𝑚1,𝑀𝑚, 𝑇𝑚\\n]\\n\\n, and because the feature\\nsequences of the three dimensions in 𝐻 all reflect the long-term trend\\nof stock prices, 𝐻 can also be seen as a global feature matrix. This\\nmultidimensional global feature matrix is input to the global feature ex-\\ntraction module (structure shown in Fig. 6) for feature extraction. TCN\\ncan effectively alleviate the gradient disappearance problem of long\\ntime series prediction by causal convolution; its powerful multi-layer\\nconvolution kernel can efficiently extract some important information\\nof the series. Based on these two advantages of TCN, we optimize\\nthe traditional temporal convolutional neural network and propose\\nthe multi-scale attention mechanism of temporal convolutional neural\\nnetwork (MA-TCN). The traditional temporal convolutional neural net-\\nwork performs the same level of convolution for the entire sequence,\\nso it cannot extract the influence of different features. The MA-TCN\\nintroduces self-attention and attention mechanisms into different parts\\nof the temporal convolutional neural network, which can dynamically\\nadjust the weight parameter of each feature attribute, resulting in a\\nmodel that is better suited to meet the actual situation and that fully\\nexplains the influence of the different attributes on the long-term trend.\\n\\nHere the feature matrix 𝐻 is input, and the objective is to extract\\nthe long-term trend features of the stock price changes.

The output\\nof the fully connected layer depends heavily on the parameter settings\\nof the anterior neural network, one parameter often has an important\\ninfluence on the whole model’s results, but our model separates the\\ntasks of different modules, reducing the global impact of parameters in\\ndifferent tasks.\\n\\nThe output model of the main task is the K-nearest neighbor model.\\nKNN is a simple algorithm with good classification effects and has been\\nwidely used in stock prediction (Chen & Hao, 2017; Nayak, Mishra, &\\nRath, 2015), and it does not require training sample data nor estimation\\nof parameters, which makes it very suitable for further prediction based\\non the extracted features. The ablation experiment in Section 5.3.2\\nshows that the accuracy of the prediction result is about 13% higher\\nthan FCL when the features extracted from the network are used.\\n\\nIn implementing the KNN algorithm, the hyperparameter K and the\\ndistance measure have a great impact on performance.

Performance comparison experiment\\nFirst, we compared some traditional models for financial time series\\n\\nforecasting that use econometrics, including BGVAR (Ahelegbey, Billio,\\n& Casarin, 2016; Ahelegbey et al., 2022), MIDAS (Gunay, Can, & Ocak,\\n2020). Then, we use normal machine learning classification models\\nsuch as Random Forest, Bayesian, and LSTM. To further verify the\\nsuperior performance of our model, we compared two advanced single-\\ntask models, Adv-ALSTM (Feng et al., 2018), SCINet (Liu, Zeng, Xu,\\nLai, & Xu, 2021), and multi-task model Bi-LSTM Seq2Seq (Mootha\\net al., 2020). In addition, we are also compare Naive algorithm (Cui,\\nXie, & Zheng, 2021) and the buy and hold algorithm. Here are brief\\ndescriptions of them:\\n\\nBGVAR:The method Bayesian graph-based approach to identifica-\\ntion in vector autoregressive (VAR) models.\\n\\nMIDAS:The method allows different frequencies to be used in a\\nregression model.\\n\\nRandom Forest:The method is to integrate many decision trees into\\na forest and use it to predict the final result.\\n\\nBayesian:The method calculates the probability that a classification\\nobject belongs to a certain class, and selects the class with the largest\\nposterior probability as the class to which the object belongs.\\n\\nLSTM:The method trains price features constructed based on histor-\\nical sequence data, obtains sequence embeddings, and then uses a fully\\nconnected layer to predict.\\n\\nAdv-ALSTM: This method proposes the use of adversarial training\\nto train the model, which significantly improves the performance of the\\nLSTM model.\\n\\nSCINet: This method constructs the basic block SCI-Block, down-\\nsamples the input features into two subsequences, and then extracts\\neach subsequence feature using different convolutional filters to retain\\nthe information of different features, and adds the learning of convo-\\nlutional features between the two sequences in each SCI-Block, finally\\nconstructing a multilayer neural network framework for prediction.\\n\\nBi-LSTM Seq2Seq: This method constructs an encoder and decoder\\nusing Bi-LSTM to input the multidimensional price features of the stock\\nand predicts multiple price series, such as closing price and opening\\nprice using a multitask learning framework.\\n\\nNaive: This method use today’s up and down as tomorrow’s buying\\nand selling signals.\\n\\nIn Table 4 shows the comparison results of our proposed COVID19-\\nMLSF model with some single-task and multi-task models, therefore\\nCOVID19-MLSF model achieves good results in the field of stock pre-\\ndiction.\\n\\nTable 4 compares our proposed COVID19-MLSF model with some\\nsingle-task and multi-task models, thus COVID19-MLSF model achieves\\ngood results in the field of stock prediction. The bar chart in Fig. 9\\nshows how our model fares against other models for each evaluation\\nmetric, and it is obvious that our method fares better than other\\nmodels for each evaluation metric.

This phenomenon was in a bear\\nmarket according to the buy-and-hold return. Table 4, Fig. 9 and Fig. 10\\ndemonstrate that using machine learning methods does increase the\\nstock market returns. Among many models, our model has achieved the\\nhighest ACC, MCC, profit and low fallback rate, which indicates that\\nour model not only provides benefits, but also reduces certain risks,\\nincluding those caused by external macroeconomic policy adjustments\\nin the stock market and COVID-19 factors.\\n\\n5.3.2. Ablation experiment\\nTo evaluate the construct external features of the stock market and\\n\\nthe effectiveness of the design module, we transform COVID19-MLSF\\ninto the following six models, and conduct experiments on the same\\ndataset.\\n\\n(1) COVID19-MLSF1 means using NMSI alone, COVID19-MLSF2\\nmeans using COVID-19 Index alone for prediction.\\n\\n(2) COVID19-MLSF3 shows that the variational modal sliding win-\\ndow decomposition method is not used.\\n\\n(3) COVID19-MLSF4 shows that in the COVID-19 feature extraction\\nmodule, the LSTM module is used to replace the MVCNN-BiLSTM-Att.\\n\\n(4) COVID19-MLSF5 shows that in the global feature extraction\\nmodule, the TCA module is used to replace the MA-TCN.\\n\\n(5) COVID19-MLSF6 shows that the decomposed stock price se-\\nquence and constructed features are all have into a feature matrix for\\nprediction.\\n\\n(6)COVID19-MLSF7 shows that NMSI and COVID-19 Index were\\ncombined with the opposite frequency signal.\\n\\n(7) KNN shows the prediction result of the main task module, which\\nis used to both comparison and ablation experiments here.\\n\\nIn Table 5 the specific results of the ablation experiments are shown,\\nand in Fig. 11, the bar chart shows the indicators between the model\\nand each ablation experiment part.\\n\\nBased on Table 5, we can draw the following conclusions can be\\ngot from the experimental results in Table 5. The COVID19-MLSF1\\nand COVID19-MLSF2 experiments proves that the constructed NMSI\\nand COVID-19 Index features are effective. The COVID19-MLSF3 ex-\\nperiment proves that the decomposition of stock price series is very\\neffective, and the decomposition of stock price series significantly\\nimproves the accuracy of stock forecasting. The COVID19-MLSF4 ex-\\nperiment proves that MVCNN-BiLSTM-Att is more effective than the\\ntraditional recurrent neural network model. The COVID19-MLSF5 ex-\\nperiment proves that MA-TCN is more effective than the traditional\\nTCN. Multi-task learning with multiple data sources, which improves\\nthe feature extraction capability of complex data, is demonstrated\\nby the experiments of the COVID19-MLSF6 and KNN experiments.\\nCOVID19-MLSF7 experiment proves NMSI is more effective when com-\\nbined with low-frequency signals, and COVID-19 Index is combined\\nwith high-frequency signals.\\n\\n\\n\\nExpert Systems With Applications 217 (2023) 119549C.

Conclusion and future work\\n\\nBy utilizing a multi-task learning framework, we propose a\\nCOVID19-MLSF stock forecasting framework that fully extracts the\\n14\\ninternal and external features of the Chinese stock market under\\nCOVID-19 pandemic. As a method of describing the external features\\nof the stock market, this paper uses the newly constructed stock\\nmarket sentiment index (NMSI) and the COVID-19 index. Two pre-\\ndiction subtask are established by combining them with decomposed\\nstock price series separately, in which one uses MA-TCN to extract\\nthe globally important stock market features, while the other uses\\n\\n\\n\\nExpert Systems With Applications 217 (2023) 119549C.

Introduction \\n\\nThe increasing prevalence of connected car data and advancements \\nin Deep Learning (DL) has enhanced the ability to model driving \\nbehavior accurately. Profiling driver risk (e.g., aggressive driving \\nbehavior, context-related risk), in particular, has a societal benefit, \\nreducing accidents and emissions. Safer driving behavior can be \\nencouraged by using bespoke insurance products (i.e., dynamically \\npriced insurance based on driver competency) or feedback to the driver. \\nThese bespoke insurance products such as pay-as/how-you-drive are \\nbecoming more prevalent in the motor insurance industry as insurers use \\na combination of telematics and Machine Learning (ML) methods for \\nrisk pricing. Traditional risk pricing models, such as the Generalized \\nLinear Models (GLM), still dominate the insurance industry, particularly \\nwithin non-life lines of business. However, in order to truly capture the \\nrelationships between the ever-expanding universe of non-traditional \\ndata (e.g. telematics, satellite, machine vision) and actuarial pricing \\nresponses (e.g., claims frequency and severity), innovative pricing \\n\\nmechanisms must be used. The DL method’s capacity to model complex, \\nnon-linear data overcomes many of the limitations of traditional pricing \\nmodels. Although, despite the increase in computational capabilities \\nafforded by DL and the availability of highly detailed telematics data, DL \\nis underutilized in insurance risk pricing and accident prediction. This \\nresearch demonstrates the usage of an alternative DL architecture, \\n‘TabNet’, in insurance risk classification. \\n\\nDeep Learning is an ML model architecture that combines or con-\\nnects multiple layers to learn from data. This multi-layered approach \\nallows each layer to learn specific traits of the presented data (Good-\\nfellow, Bengio, & Courville, 2016). Advancements in DL have led to \\nhighly accurate models, outperforming traditional ML methods in \\nnumerous domains, such as autonomous driving, natural language \\nprocessing, and marketing (Goodfellow et al., 2016). In addition, these \\nDL models can learn complex data structures with minimal effort in pre- \\nprocessing and feature engineering (LeCun, Bengio, & Hinton, 2015). \\nHowever, insurance risk prediction models underutilize DL due to their \\n‘black-box’ theoretical design/framework. As a result, the explainability \\n\\n* Corresponding author. \\nE-mail addresses: Kevin.McDonnell@ul.ie (K. McDonnell), Finbarr.Murphy@ul.ie (F. Murphy), Barry.Sheehan@ul.ie (B.

Despite the ability of DL models to \\nlearn complex data structures, Deep Networks generalize poorly on \\ntabular datasets compared with other Classical ML models such as \\nSupport Vector Machines, Logistic Regression and naive Bayes classifier \\n(Arik & Pfister, 2021). Restrictions applied to granular telematics \\ndatasets cause further complications for using DL in insurance, as \\nnascent regulation requires the anonymization and processing of raw \\ntelematics data, ensuing that tabular datasets are commonplace in in-\\nsurance (Masello et al., 2022; McDonnell et al., 2021; Sheehan, Murphy, \\nRyan, Mullins, & Liu, 2017). Another significant limitation to their \\nadoption in insurance is their complex overparameterized configura-\\ntions (Wüthrich, 2020). \\n\\nModels used for risk pricing need to be interpretable in insurance to \\nbe accepted by financial authorities (Bibal, Lognoul, de Streel, & Frénay, \\n2021). GLMs and Ensemble methods have proven effective in deter-\\nmining and quantifying risk for certain driving profiles and are regularly \\nused in insurance risk pricing (Ayuso, Guillen, & Nielsen, 2019; Shan-\\nnon, Murphy, Mullins, & Eggert, 2018; Wang & Xi, 2016; Wu, Zhang, & \\nDong, 2016). Additionally, GLMs are interpretable, a fundamental \\nproperty required to create premium pricing models for insurance \\n(Guelman, 2012). However, the performance of GLM can be constrained \\nby highly complex or high dimensional data, as the linear predictor \\ncannot accurately model high-dimensional covariate effects (Klein, \\nDenuit, Lang, & Kneib, 2014). Ensemble methods such as Random Forest \\nor XGBoost can learn complex data structures while also returning high \\nlevels of accuracy. However, these ensemble learning methods have \\ndrawbacks as complicated processes for both model-tuning and model \\ninterpretability can lead them to be unattractive for insurers (Pesantez- \\nNarvaez, Guillen, & Alcañiz, 2019). For this reason, ‘black-box’ models \\nare unfavorable. \\n\\nThe limitations of GLM, XGBoost and DL can have varying implica-\\ntions for an insurer’s effectiveness in providing accurate pricing models \\nfor motor insurance. Additionally, both XGBoost and DL differ from GLM \\nin their ability to provide fully explainable and interpretable pricing \\nmodels, further limiting their usage. TabNet, a state-of-the-art DL ar-\\nchitecture, addresses the limitations of DL models. Arik and Pfister \\n(2021) introduced TabNet in their paper, citing comparative accuracy to \\nXGBoost. TabNet utilizes single deep learning, multi-step processing, \\nsequential attention, and gradient descent, creating an architecture that \\ndiffers from traditional DL while maintaining high accuracy and \\nproviding model interpretability. The combination of these design \\nchoices makes TabNet a suitable DL model for insurance risk pricing and \\naddresses the limitations of the other models. \\n\\nTo the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first adoption \\nof TabNet (Arik & Pfister, 2021) for insurance risk classification via \\nclaims prediction. In this article, TabNet is compared against GLM and \\nXGBoost to demonstrate its effectiveness in accuracy, interpretability, \\nand minimizing effort in feature training. For completeness, an addi-\\ntional experiment introduces a LightGBM and Neural Network to test \\nTabNet’s predictive qualities. This state-of-the-art DL architecture pro-\\nvides highly efficient policyholder risk prediction for insurers, using a \\ncombination of connected car data and traditional policyholder data. \\nThe implications of using this novel approach allow insurers to price \\nindividual drivers on their driving performances better when compared \\nto traditional pricing models. \\n\\nGLMs have widespread adoption in insurance risk classification and \\npricing due to their ability to capture the parameterized relationship \\nbetween variables in driver risk classification and their response or ef-\\nfects (McCullagh & Nelder, 2019; Renshaw, 1994). The occurrence of \\nclaims or accidents is infrequent; therefore, distributions such as the \\nnormal distribution inadequately model these sparsely distributed ac-\\ncidents and claims. The GLM can vary its assumptions about the distri-\\nbutions of its response variables, allowing for the usage of distributions, \\nsuch as Poisson regression (Ma, Zhu, Hu, & Chiu, 2018), that can better \\n\\napproximate relationships between risk factors and accidents. Addi-\\ntionally, GLMs are highly interpretable due to the generalized form of \\ndistribution and link-function selection. Due to these generalized terms, \\ninteractions between weights and variables of the GLM on a dataset can \\nbe easily interpreted (Molnar, 2020). \\n\\nCombining classical policyholder data with telematics data has \\nincreased an insurer’s ability to price policies accurately. Verbelen, \\nAntonio, and Claeskens (2018) demonstrate the effectiveness of this \\napproach by combining these traditional factors with telematics data to \\npredict claims. The authors utilized a variant of the GLM, a Generalized \\nAdditive Model, to model risk effectively through telematics data. The \\nGLM model highlighted exposure or mileage as a primary contributing \\nfactor to a policyholder’s risk. Another variant of GLM, Poisson \\nRegression, also provided accurate risk profile predictions for Ma et al. \\n(2018). When combining traditional and telematics data, their GLM \\nmodel identified mileage, traveling at peak times, and driving behaviors \\nsuch as harsh braking as highly correlated with driver accidents. Addi-\\ntionally, their model identified speeding and relative speed as risk fac-\\ntors. Thus, GLM models can provide premium pricing models for \\ninsurers while also providing interpretable results, exposing significant \\nfeatures contributing to a policyholder’s risk. \\n\\nAlthough GLMs have proven effective at driver risk identification \\nand premium pricing, there are limitations to using these models. Linear \\npredictors find difficulty obtaining optimal solutions when learning \\nfrom complex or high-dimensional data; this results in a GLM ineffi-\\nciently capturing the correlations in the dataset leading to poor gener-\\nalization (Klein et al., 2014). This limitation implies that models, which \\nuse linear predictors, may be unsuitable for predicting risky behaviors \\nfrom high-dimensional telematics data. GLMs also require tedious \\nmanual pre-processing, feature engineering and model building pro-\\ncesses to extract the relevant correlations and covariate effects on crash \\ndata or claims data (Henckaerts, Antonio, Clijsters, & Verbelen, 2018). \\n\\nEnsemble ML algorithms have risen in popularity in the insurance \\ndomain. These machine learners can learn complex data structures, \\nreducing the need for extensive feature engineering and provide inter-\\npretable results for insurers (Guelman, 2012). Ensemble methods \\ncombine base classifiers to produce one optimal predictive model. For \\nexample, a decision tree is a tree-based structure algorithm used to \\npredict a class or value by learning simple decision rules. Singular de-\\ncision trees, however, are prone to overfitting and variable selection bias \\n(Quan & Valdez, 2018). Combining decision trees in an ensemble \\nmethod such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting improves the \\nperformance of these base classifiers, reducing overfitting tendencies \\nand significantly improving the accuracy of these models. \\n\\nEnsemble methods used in driver behavior risk scoring have greatly \\nimproved risk pricing models’ prediction accuracy, outperforming GLMs \\non the same task. An important waypoint in advocating the value of \\nensemble methods in risk pricing is Guelman (2012), who compared \\nGLM and Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT) on driver risk classification. The \\nGBT model could outperform the GLM on risk pricing based on tradi-\\ntional risk factors and accident data. A comprehensive study by Noll, \\nSalzmann, and Wuthrich (2018) compared variants of ensemble \\nmethods against Neural Networks and GLM. The study showed that \\nensemble methods performed better than GLM when predicting claims \\non traditional pricing features. In particular, GBT outperformed Random \\nForest on the same dataset. Recent studies by Pesantez-Narvaez et al. \\n(2019) and Maillart (2021) combine the predictive power of ensemble \\nmethods with driver behavioral data. In Mailart’s paper, ensemble \\nmethods were compared against a GLM, providing accurate and \\nexplainable results while reducing the need for extensive preprocessing \\nand feature engineering. \\n\\nThere are limitations to using ensemble methods for insurance risk \\npricing. Ensemble methods have basic levels of interpretability; for an \\ninsurer, gaining sufficient levels of model interpretability for auditing or \\nfinancial regulatory purposes from these models is a complex task \\n(Henckaerts, Côté, Antonio, & Verbelen, 2021; Noll et al., 2018). \\n\\nK. McDonnell et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \\n\\n\\n\\nExpert Systems With Applications 217 (2023) 119543\\n\\n3\\n\\nEnsemble methods can also be challenging to train. The fine-tuning of \\nthe hyper-parameters can be a difficult task and, when compared to \\nsimpler models such as Logistic Regression, the reward for the additional \\neffort can sometimes be negligible (Pesantez-Narvaez et al., 2019). \\n\\nDL has drastically changed the landscape of natural language pro-\\ncessing, image recognition, and autonomous driving. However, these \\npowerful models have limited usage in insurance pricing and risk clas-\\nsifications tasks. DL is a multi-layered approach to learning, where each \\nlayer extracts latent features and updates connected nodes and weights \\naccording to their relevance to scoring (Goodfellow et al., 2016). A \\nmixture of feed-forward and backpropagation steps ensures that each \\nweight is adjusted accordingly between the hidden layers of the \\nnetwork, where each layer outputs a vector of learned salient features, \\nfeeding this output vector to the next layer. \\n\\nStudies employing DL models in insurance risk classification and \\npricing are limited. However, there is growing adoption of these highly \\naccurate models. Before the growth of DL models, numerous studies \\ntested the feasibility of DL in insurance risk pricing. Paefgen et al. (2013) \\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of DL in predicting accident risk from \\ntelematics data. The authors compare a DL model with Logistic \\nRegression and Decision Tree models. Although the DL model out-\\nperformed the other models in various metrics, Paefgen et al. (2013) \\nchose Logistic Regression as their favored choice due to the low inter-\\npretability of the DL model. In a similar study, Baecke and Bocca (2017) \\ncompared a DL model with a Random Forest and Logistic Regression \\nmodel on driver risk classification using telematics data. Like Paefgen \\net al. (2013), Baecke and Bocca (2017) also decided that the Logistic \\nRegression model was the best choice, although the DL outperformed \\nthe other models on various categories. In addition to the above studies, \\nnumerous authors introduced specially tailored DL models for insur-\\nance. For instance, in their comparative model study, (Noll et al., 2018) \\nintroduced a shallow, deep Neural Network (NN) architecture for DL on \\na telematics dataset for intended insurance use. (Noll et al., 2018) made \\nsignificant changes to the NN model, with the highest performance \\nachieved by introducing an exposure feature layer to the network, out-\\nperforming GLM and Ensemble methods on the task of claim prediction. \\nAn alternative DL architecture by (Siami, Naderpour, & Lu, 2021) cre-\\nates a three-step approach to driver behavior extraction for subsequent \\nrisk analysis. In their paper, (Siami et al., 2021) reduce the complexity of \\ntelematics data processing the data using a self-organizing map (SOM). \\nA 9-layer deep autoencoder extracts relevant features before a k-means \\nalgorithm clusters the dataset in the final two steps. The resulting \\nclusters identify specific risky driver behaviors or patterns contributing \\nto a driver’s overall risk. \\n\\nLearning from tabular data can be challenging for DL models to find \\nan optimal solution, as the sparse and heterogeneous tabular datasets \\nlimit the DL model’s ability to find an appropriate inductive bias (Arik & \\nPfister, 2021; Shavitt & Segal, 2018; Xu, Skoularidou, Cuesta-Infante, & \\nVeeramachaneni, 2019). Additionally, due to regulation, the limitation \\nof access to granular telematics data combined with low interpretability \\nis a crucial obstacle to the widespread adoption of DL models in insur-\\nance risk pricing (Baecke & Bocca, 2017; McDonnell et al., 2021; Paef-\\ngen et al., 2013). \\n\\nThis research extends on the works of Arik and Pfister (2021), \\nPaefgen et al. (2013), and Pesantez-Narvaez et al. (2019) by using a DL \\nmodel, TabNet, for insurance risk pricing. Furthermore, this research \\nprovides the first comparison of TabNet, ML and traditional insurance \\npricing models. TabNet for insurance pricing offers accuracy with high \\nmodel interpretability and reduced effort in data pre-processing. In \\naddition, this model is capable of predicting accidents by combining \\ntelematics data and insurance claims. The rest of this paper is organized \\nas follows: Section 2 describes the dataset and pre-processing steps, \\nSection 3 outlines the methodology, Section 4 and Section 5 discusses \\nthe results in detail; finally, Section 6 provides a conclusion and future \\nwork. \\n\\n2. Data \\n\\nThe dataset used in this study is a synthetic telematics dataset pro-\\nvided by So et al. (2021). This synthetic data is modeled on a real dataset \\nprovided by a Canadian insurer and generated using Synthetic Minority \\nOversampling Tech (SMOTE) and a feedforward Neural Network (NN) \\nfor data simulation. For evaluation purposes, the usage of Poisson and \\nGamma Regression ensures that the distribution of claims data links to \\nthe sparsity of actual data claims. \\n\\nThe dataset contains 100,000 data samples and 52 variables divided \\ninto three categories: Traditional data (Car age, Insured Age, gender), \\nTelematic data (total miles driven, harsh acceleration, harsh braking), \\nand Response Data (number of claims and aggregate number of claims). \\nThe breakdown of features per category is 11 Traditional Features, 39 \\ntelematics features, and 2 response variables. Table 1 contains a sum-\\nmary of the features and datatypes. \\n\\nThe response column within this dataset contains two variables, \\nNB_Claim and AMT_claim. As per Table 1, AMT_Claim is the aggregated \\nsum of claims paid out from the insurance company, and NB_Claim is the \\nnumber of claims made by a policyholder account. A driver with \\nNB_Claim = 1 and AMT_Claim<€1,000 may indicate first-party damage \\nrather than a high-risk driver with third-party damages. Therefore, \\ndistinguishing between risky and non-risky drivers requires the creation \\nof a new response column. The definition of this new response variable \\n’ClaimYN’ is as follows: where NB_Claim > 1 & AMT_Claim >€1,000, \\n\\nTable 1 \\nSummary and descriptions of Traditional and Telematic variables in synthetic \\ndataset (So et al., 2021).  \\n\\nCategory Feature Names Description Datatype \\n\\nTraditional Marital \\nInsured.sex \\nCar.use \\nRegion \\nTerritory \\n\\nMarital Status  \\n\\nGender: Male/Female \\nPrivate/Commute/Farmer/ \\nCommercial \\nRural/Urban \\nLocation of Vehicle \\n\\nCategorical \\n\\nDuration \\nInsured.age \\nCar.age \\nCredit.score \\nAnnual.miles. \\ndrive \\nYears.noclaims \\n\\nPolicy in days  \\n\\nAge in years \\nVehicle age in years \\nCredit score of Policyholder \\nExpected miles of driver \\nYears without claims \\n\\nNumerical \\n\\nTelematic Total.miles.driven \\nAvgdays.week \\nAccel.xxmiles* \\nBrake.xxmiles* \\nLeft.turn. \\nintensityxx* \\nRight.turn. \\nintensityxx* \\n\\nTotal Miles \\nMean aggregated days per week \\nHarsh Acc in mph (xx) per 1000 \\nmiles \\nHarsh Brake in mph (xx) per \\n1000 miles \\nLeft turn per 1000 miles with \\nintensity xx  \\n\\nRight turn per 1000 miles with \\nintensity xx \\n\\nNumerical  \\n\\nAnnual.pct.driven \\nPct.drive.(day) \\nPct.drive.xhrs \\nPct.drive.wkxxx*  \\n\\nPct.drive.rushxx* \\n\\nAnnual percentage for time on \\nroad  \\n\\nDriving percentage for a given \\nday of week \\nHours of driving percentage for \\nhourly period \\nDriving percentage for a given \\nwk(end/day)  \\n\\nDriving percentage during rush \\nhour (am/pm) \\n\\nPercentage \\n\\nResponse NB_Claim \\nAMT_Claim \\nClaimYN** \\n\\nNum of policy claims \\nTotal claims amount \\nRisky drivers \\n\\nNumerical \\n\\n*xx values pre-defined buckets of values rather than random variables. \\n**Newly created variables, not in original dataset. \\n\\nK.

Methodology \\n\\nThe following section describes the approach of classifying driver \\nrisk using driver behavioral data from telematics and comparing the \\nperformance of TabNet against GLM and XGBoost. Driver features are \\ndefined as x0, x1,⋯, xn, where x is a driver’s feature (e.g. harsh accel-\\neration event, harsh braking event, distance traveled) and n is the total \\nnumber of features in the dataset. The target variable ClaimYN, for risk \\nclassification, is defined in section 2. \\n\\nTo demonstrate the intrinsic benefits of TabNet as a suitable risk \\npricing model, TabNet needs to achieve comparable or better perfor-\\nmance than traditional risk insurance models GLM & XGBoost. This \\nstudy’s evaluation of TabNet compares TabNet’s accuracy, model \\ninterpretability, and the reduced need for involved feature engineering \\nprocesses. Comparing the accuracy of each model will use additional \\nscoring metrics to gain further insights into each model’s predictive \\nprowess. These scoring metrics are: F1-Score, Precision, Recall, Area \\nUnder the Curve (AUC), Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), ac-\\ncuracy and Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient. Evaluation of model \\ninterpretability requires each model to provide clear and insightful de-\\nscriptions of data trends and identify reasonable significant risk factors. \\nAdditionally, three levels of pre-processing requirements evaluate each \\nmodel’s ability to provide accurate results with different levels of pre- \\nprocessing effort. Models, which require less effort to provide accurate \\nresults, indicate to insurers the model’s suitability for usage. Table 2 \\ncontains a summary of the evaluation methods used in this study. \\n\\n3.1. TabNet \\n\\nTabNet is a single deep learning model based on sequential multistep \\nprocessing (Arik & Pfister, 2021). This single deep architecture assists in \\nfeature selection and improves the capacity to learn high-dimensional \\nfeatures. Each nth step processes a D-dimensional feature vector, \\nwhere each step outputs to a Feature Transformer block. This Feature \\nTransformer block contains multiple layers, either shared across deci-\\nsion steps or unique to a decision step. Each block contains fully- \\nconnected layers, a batch normalization layer, and a Gated Liner Unit \\n(GLU) activation. Additionally, the GLU connects to a normalization \\n\\nresidual connection; this helps stabilize the variance throughout the \\nnetwork. This multi-layered block assists in feature selection and in-\\ncreases the parameter efficiency of the network. Fig. 1 provides a \\ndetailed description of TabNet architecture. \\n\\nThe Feature Transformer connects to the Attentive Transformer and \\nMask; these processes ensure robust feature selection per step. The \\nAttentive Transformer is a multi-layered block with fully connected and \\nbatch normalization layers. The Attentive Transformer and masking \\nprocedure is formulated by \\n\\na[i − 1] : M[i] = sparsemax(P[i − 1].hi([a − 1])) (1)  \\n\\nwhere a[i − 1] is the previous step, P[i] is the priori scale and hi some \\ntrainable function. Two key elements of the Attentive Transformer are \\nthe sparsemax activation function and the prior. Sparsemax reduces \\ndimensionality by introducing sparsity into feature vectors; and then \\nprojecting these features onto a probability map in Euclidean space. \\nEach projected feature vector now has an associated probability, \\nassisting in model interpretability. The prior scale term, P[i], denotes the \\nsaliency of a feature throughout the previous steps and is defined as \\n\\nP[i] = Πi\\nj=1(γ − M[j]) (2)  \\n\\nwhere γ defines the relationship between enforcement of a feature at one \\ndecision step or multiple steps. When γ = 1 the feature is enforced at the \\ngiven step and multiple steps when γ = 0. The Attentive Transformer \\nselects the most salient features to form the transformed feature vector \\nand passes these features to the learnable Mask, M[j]. The Mask enables \\ninterpretability and further improves upon feature selection from the \\nAttentive Transformer. Mbj[i] defines the jth feature of the bth sample; \\nwhen Mbj[i] = 0, there is no contribution from the feature at that step. \\nAggregating these Masks at each step creates a coefficient that weights \\nthe importance of each step in a final decision. \\n\\nTabNet can provide both local and global model interpretability, \\nwith local interpretability an intrinsic element in TabNet’s design. \\nGlobal interpretability is obtained through the Python library Scikit- \\nlearn (Pedregosa et al., 2011), while local interpretability is obtained \\nby accessing TabNet’s decision masks. Each mask scores features, which \\ncontributed to the model decision at that step, and each step produces a \\nmask. TabNet is available through PyTorch version 3.1.1 (Pytorch- \\nTabnet, 2021). \\n\\n3.2. XGBoost \\n\\nExtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is an ensemble boosting tree \\nalgorithm. This fast and efficient ML algorithm can outperform other ML \\nmodels in accuracy, speed, and efficiency (Chen & Guestrin, 2016). \\nBoosting is an inherent feature of XGBoost, where previous weak \\nlearners are boosted by creating new models. These models are com-\\nbined to make a final prediction. Gradient descent is used during the \\nnew model creation process to minimize the loss. XGBoost deviates from \\nboost or gradient boosting through the incorporation of regularization \\n(Lasso & Ridge Regression), tree creation parallelization, and tree \\npruning (after the tree has grown to max depth, start from the bottom \\nand traverse up pruning invalid decisions). This approach uses featur-\\ne_importances to return global model interpretability in XGBoost. \\n\\n3.3. GLm \\n\\nThe GLM model is a generic form of the linear model. Unlike the \\nLinear Regression model, GLM does not make assumptions on the dis-\\ntribution of the trainable data. For example, a normal distribution does \\nnot accurately represent sparsity in claims data. The correct choice of \\ndistribution and link-function is necessary to provide accurate pre-\\ndictions of risk. The GLM model can be formally defined as follows \\n\\ng(EY(y ∨ x)) = β0 + β1x1 +⋯+ βpxp (3) \\n\\nTable 2 \\nSummary of the evaluation methods used in this study. Model \\nevaluation is divided into three categories, Scoring, Interpret-\\nability and Pre-processing. Scoring refers to model performance \\nmetrics such as F1-score or accuracy. Using the pre-processing \\nmethods listed, a high-scoring model with minimal user involve-\\nment indicates a good choice for an insurer. A model is highly \\ninterpretable if it can provide global and local interpretability and \\ninsights into telematics data using the interpretability methods.  \\n\\nCategory Method \\n\\nScoring F1-Score  \\n\\nPrecision \\nRecall \\nAccuracy \\nAUC \\nROC \\n\\nInterpretability Feature Importance  \\n\\nExplain Matrix \\nPre-Processing Data Normalization \\n\\nData Standardization  \\n\\nHyper-parameter tuning \\nFeature Engineering  \\n\\nK. McDonnell et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \\n\\n\\n\\nExpert Systems With Applications 217 (2023) 119543\\n\\n5\\n\\nwhere g defines the link function and EY the probability distribution. The \\nchoice of GLM for this study is the Logistic Regression model. Scikit- \\nlearn’s implementation of Logistic Regression does not contain the \\nfeature_importances attribute; instead, the regression coefficients were \\nused which reflect whether a feature contributed to the negative case (e. \\ng., ‘ClaimYN = 0′, if coefficient < 0); conversely, positive values indicate \\nthe positive case (e.g., ‘ClaimYN = 1′, if coefficient > 0). \\n\\n3.4. Pre-processing level 1–3 \\n\\nTo demonstrate how using a DL model such as TabNet reduces the \\nneed for involved model building and feature engineering, TabNet is \\ncompared against XGBoost and GLM testing various degrees of pre- \\nprocessing. The initial test restricts the capabilities of the GLM, \\nXGBoost, and TabNet models by passing raw data to each model and \\nrunning with the default hyperparameters. The only pre-processing that \\noccurs in this step is simply encoding categorical columns. The purpose \\nof this restricted test run is to document each model’s performance with \\nlimited effort in pre-processing. Subsequent levels of testing require \\nmore involved pre-processing, feature engineering, and model building \\nsteps. The second level of pre-processing involves scaling and data \\nnormalization, along with minor model hyperparameter tuning. Data \\nnormalization for this step is simply StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler. \\n\\nThe final level requires more involved feature engineering and model \\nbuilding steps. Standardization and normalization steps continue from \\nthe previous level. The features Accel.xxmiles, Brake.xxmiles, Left.turn. \\nintensityxx and Right.turn.intensityxx, signifies harsh driving events. \\nThese values are highly correlated and will benefit from being aggre-\\ngated. Therefore, aggregating related harsh driving events to assist in \\nthis step’s feature engineering requirement. The optimal hyper-\\nparameters for each model were extracted using RandomizedSearchCV \\nwith 10-fold-cross validation. \\n\\nThis study introduces a state-of-the-art model, LightGBM, and a \\nNeural Network (NN) in a final test to determine the robustness of \\nTabNet’s ability to predict claims. The LightGBM and NN undergo the \\nsame training and testing processes described in 3.4. In addition, the \\nLightGBM model requires a similar setup to the XGBoost in hyper-\\nparameter tuning. The NN, however, requires more involved tuning due \\n\\nto configuration requirements for hidden and dropout layers and nodes. \\nThis final test for completeness provides an additional endorsement for \\ndetermining TabNet’s suitability for real-life insurance uses. \\n\\n4. Results \\n\\nThe following section describes the performance of TabNet \\ncompared with GLMs and XGBoost for both Classification and Regres-\\nsion tasks. For each round of model fitting and evaluation, an 80/20 split \\nof training and test dataset combined with 10-fold cross-validation \\nensure the integrity of each model’s performance metrics. \\n\\nTable 3 illustrates each model’s returned accuracy per level. Each \\nmodel scores high accuracy for each level; however, due to the sparsity \\nof driver claims, i.e., relatively few claims in the data, this metric can be \\n\\nFig. 1. Architecture of TabNet. Each step contains an attentive transformer, mask, feature transformer, split node and ReLu activation. Steps are sequential, \\nincreasing up to N steps before connecting to a fully connected layer and the output. Attentive Transformer contains a fully connected layer, batch normalization, \\nprior scale and sparsemax dimensionality reduction. The mask function outputs significant feature contributions for aggregation. When Mb,j[i] = 0, there is no feature \\ncontribution. \\n\\nTable 3 \\nReturned results for each model per level of preprocessing. Compared to \\nXGBoost and Logistic Regression, TabNet scores highest in F1-Score in three out \\nof two levels. Additionally, the model returns the highest Recall values overall. \\nXGBoost scores highest in precision and AUC in all three rounds of testing. Lo-\\ngistic Regression is the worst performing model of the three. Each model returns \\na high accuracy value. However, high accuracy does not sufficiently represent \\nthe performance of each model in predicting claims, as demonstrated by the \\nvarying F1, Precision, Recall and AUC values. Therefore, Matthews Correlation \\nCoefficient can assist in determining model performance on an unbalanced \\ndataset. XGBoost and TabNet score relatively closely using this metric, although \\nXGBoost edges TabNet in two out of three rounds.  \\n\\nModel Performance \\n\\nLevel Model Precision Recall F1- \\nScore \\n\\nAUC Accuracy M \\nCorr \\n\\n1 TabNet  0.55  0.20  0.30  0.86  0.97  0.32 \\nLR  0.11  0.00  0.00  0.73  0.97  0.01 \\nXGB  0.85  0.19  0.31  0.90  0.98  0.34 \\n\\n2 TabNet  0.66  0.53  0.59  0.88  0.98  0.58 \\nLR  0.25  0.00  0.00  0.81  0.97  0.01 \\nXGB  0.85  0.37  0.51  0.91  0.98  0.54 \\n\\n3 TabNet  0.66  0.55  0.60  0.87  0.98  0.59 \\nLR  0.33  0.00  0.01  0.80  0.97  0.03 \\nXGB  0.88  0.42  0.57  0.91  0.98  0.6 \\n\\nM Corr = Matthews Correlation, LR = Logistic Regression, XGB = XGBoost. \\n\\nK.

For this \\nreason, f1-score, precision, recall, AUC, ROC and Matthews Correlation \\nCoefficient are considered valuable metrics for model assessment. When \\ncomparing the three models’ scores, TabNet returns the highest F1-Score \\nfor all three levels of testing, also having the highest recall scores for two \\nout of three levels. Additionally, TabNet provides the most balanced set \\nof results compared to the two other models. In contrast, XGBoost has \\nreturned the highest Precision and AUC score. Both TabNet and XGBoost \\nhave comparable performance with Matthews Correlation, with \\nXGBoost scoring higher in the first round. Logistic Regression performs \\npoorly throughout the testing, failing to predict potential claims or ac-\\ncidents accurately. Fig. 2 summarizes each model’s performance for \\nAUC and ROC. \\n\\nAs per the methodology, each round of testing requires minimal to \\ninvolved preprocessing steps. For the second round of testing, XGBoost \\nrequired only two changes to its hyperparameters to improve its per-\\nformance, while TabNet required three, including an increase in epochs. \\nAs a result, the running time for TabNet doubled. Tuning the hyper-\\nparameters of Logistic Regression had little impact on the model per-\\nformance, with a marginal increase in precision recorded for the model. \\nFinally, RandomizedSearchCV was used to improve each model’s score \\nby selecting hyperparameters randomly in a given range, and the best \\nscore for a set of hyperparameters was retained. The optimal parameter \\nselection had minimal impact on TabNet’s and Logistic Regression’s \\nmodel performance, although XGBoost improved from the parameter \\ntuning. Tuning TabNet’s scores via RandomizedSearchCV was difficult \\n\\ndue to a substantial increase in model running time, and the scope of the \\nrandom search was severely limited. Despite the attempts to improve the \\nLogistic Regression score, the model still fails to identify driver risk from \\nthe dataset. In a final test for completeness, TabNet underwent addi-\\ntional analysis against a LightGBM and NN. The LightGBM and NN \\nprovided disappointing results despite the increased efforts required for \\ntraining. The LightGBM and NN failed to score higher than 0.2 in f1- \\nscore and Matthew’s Correlation coefficient, respectively. \\n\\nModel interpretability is a core component in analyzing and evalu-\\nating each model’s performance in this study. Comparing each model’s \\nfeature importance and model coefficients gives insight into model de-\\ncisions. Table 4 contains a detailed breakdown of each model’s returned \\nfeature importances. The NN and LightGBM tests did not introduce \\nsignificant insights into model decisions not already captured by Tab-\\nNet, XGBoost or Logistic Regression. As expected, extracting informa-\\ntion from the NN, in particular, proved a difficult challenge. \\n\\nTabNet can return the decision mask used internally for decision- \\nmaking, enabling further insight into local model interpretability. For \\nexample, the first mask returned from the model shows that both \\ntraditional and telematics variables contribute to model decisions at a \\nlocal level, with Right.turn.intensity11 scoring highly. Subsequent \\nmasks signify that Total.miles.driven, Accel.09miles and Duration have \\ncontributed to the model decision at a particular step. The internal mask \\nis an inherent property of TabNet; therefore, accessing and using this \\nproperty is easy. Comparing similar functionality with XGBoost and \\nother ML models, TabNet excels at providing in-depth model analytics \\n\\nFig. 2. AUC and ROC curves for each model per level of testing. XGBoost consistently returns the highest AUC values. However, as per the Precision-Recall Curve, \\nTabNet returns the most balanced recall/precision values, while XGBoost scores low in recall and high in precision consistently. Additionally, TabNet scores highest \\nin f1-score for levels two and three despite decreasing precision. Logistic Regression performs slightly better than no skill for Precision and Recall but still maintains a \\nhigh AUC score. \\n\\nK.

Discussion \\n\\nAs per the results presented in Section 4 TabNet provides high levels \\nof model interpretability and accuracy. TabNet was able to detect and \\nclassify driver risk using a combination of both traditional and tele-\\nmatics variables. When compared to XGBoost, TabNet can outperform \\nthis model on some classification metrics. However, XGBoost requires \\nless intensive processing and hyperparameter tuning to achieve high \\nlevels of accuracy. When comparing each model’s ability to provide \\ninterpretable results, TabNet exceeds XGBoost and GLM by returning \\nboth global and local interpretability. \\n\\n5.1. Model performance \\n\\nTabNet is a robust DL algorithm that has shown promising results for \\nthe task of Risk classification. However, training the TabNet model \\nposed some challenges, which prevented the model from demonstrating \\nthe same learning capabilities as other DL models. The TabNet model \\ntends to overfit the data and despite adjusting the available regulari-\\nzation parameters (the decision prediction and attention embedding \\nlayers); this had a marginal effect on the model performance. This form \\nof regularization is not as sophisticated as DL equivalents such as \\ndropout or weight constraint (Goodfellow et al., 2016). Additionally, \\ncriticisms of DL being over-parameterized and difficult to train also \\napply to TabNet. With limited hardware resources, training TabNet can \\ntake a considerable amount of time. XGBoost in comparison excels in \\nmost fields, with less extensive model building or effort required for \\ngood generalization. \\n\\nThe performance of Logistic Regression compared to both TabNet \\nand XGBoost demonstrates the limitations of GLM in classifying risk on a \\nhighly dimensional dataset, including both traditional and telematics \\nvariables. Logistic Regression performed poorly on the f1-score in \\nparticular and could not provide accurate estimates of precision and \\nrecall. PCA was used to reduce the dimensionality and complexity of the \\n\\ndataset for the final phase of testing, although the improvement to \\nmodel performance was insignificant. Logistic Regression still per-\\nformed well in AUC and ROC but never surpassed the performance of \\nTabNet or XGBoost. The poor model performance demonstrates that the \\nmodel found difficulty in correctly distinguishing between risky and \\nnon-risky drivers from the telematics data. \\n\\nDespite the aforementioned limitations of TabNet, the results are \\npromising for the usage of this model in detecting claims from telematics \\ndata. TabNet could predict higher Recall and f1-scores than XGBoost and \\nLogistic Regression on most tasks. For insurers, this is an important \\nscoring metric, as high levels of Recall infer the model’s capability in \\ndetecting true positive cases of risky driving behavior. In addition, ROC \\nand AUC metrics do not fully represent the sparsity of claims in the \\ndataset, high values of this score are misleading. As a result, the high f1- \\nscore and Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient from TabNet signify that \\nthe model captures the sparsity in claims data, outperforming or \\nequaling XGBoost. The addition of the final test for robustness also \\ndemonstrates TabNet’s potential for usage in insurance. The LightGBM \\nand NN models did not achieve any notable improvements in f1-score, or \\nMatthew’s Correlation Coefficient even when compared against the \\nLogistic Regression model. In addition, the LightGBM and NN required \\nextensive effort to achieve their training score, while TabNet and \\nXGBoost required less training for better performance. Since TabNet is a \\nDL model, access to larger datasets could drastically improve predictive \\nperformance. Model performance may also improve if trained on a real \\ndataset instead of a synthetic dataset, as this data may not fully represent \\nthe chosen target variable. \\n\\nThe final test conducted compared an additional two models against \\nTabNet. These models did not achieve any notable improvements in f1- \\nscore, or Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient even when compared \\nagainst the Logistic Regression model. In addition, the LightGBM and \\nNN required extensive effort to achieve their training score, while \\nTabNet and XGBoost required less training for better performance. \\n\\n5.2. Model interpretability \\n\\nEach model tested in this paper provided a set of features’ impor-\\ntances or model coefficients; however, the clarity of the decisions made \\nand the significance of these features were sometimes not as apparent. \\nFor instance, these features may be weighted differently, with some \\nvariation from the initial run. However, ranking these features and \\ndefining commonality between each returned feature for a model is \\nbeneficial, as repeated instances of the same features used may indicate \\na contributor to some risk cases. Once an insurer selects a production \\nmodel, these features will remain constant. However, for a model to be \\nfully interpretable, there needs to be a repeatable and easily definable \\nmethod to return model decisions to provide model decision clarity for \\nregulatory or auditing purposes (Actuarial Standards Board, 2020; \\nCouncil of the European Union, 2016; Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, \\n2015). For example, using p-values or model coefficients, insurers or \\nauditors can easily access model decisions from a Logistic Regression \\nmodel, negating the risk of being in breach of regulation. In contrast, the \\nfeatures’ importances returned by XGBoost score each feature uniformly \\nbefore choosing the most relevant set of features. The scoring behavior \\nof the XGBoost model is due to the ensemble decision function, where \\ndecision nodes split based on weak classifiers. These weak classifiers \\ncontribute to features’ importance until a ‘champion’ set of features \\nbecomes part of the final solution. Additionally, the NN used in the study \\nproved challenging to extract meaningful interior model decisions, a \\nknown disadvantage of using these models (Baecke & Bocca, 2017; \\nPaefgen et al., 2013). The internal decision process is hidden from the \\nuser unless specialist software is used (Gramegna & Giudici, 2020). \\nThus, explaining model decisions and interpreting results becomes a \\ndifficult task. \\n\\nTransitioning away from a GLM is difficult for insurers due to the \\nneed for model clarity and interpretability. Therefore, the black-box \\n\\nTable 4 \\nThe top four feature importances’ for each model tested per level. Bolded values \\nare traditional or classical risk pricing variables; all other values are telematics \\nvariables. Each model used in this study has favored telematics variables over \\ntraditional or classical variables when making risk predictions. TabNet, in \\nparticular, does not use any traditional variables when making predictions. \\nUnderlined features represent commonality between each model.  \\n\\nFeature Importance \\n\\nLevel TabNet XGBoost Logistic Regression \\n\\nFeature \\n\\n1 Annual.miles.drive \\nPct.drive.wkday \\nRight.turn.intensity11 \\nAnnual.pct.driven \\n\\nRegion \\nAnnual.miles.drive \\nAccel.12miles \\nAccel.11miles \\n\\nCar.age* \\nDuration* \\nLeft.turn.intensity12** \\nAnnual.miles.drive** \\n\\n2 Pct.drive.rush am \\nBrake.14miles \\nRight.turn.intensity08 \\nPct.drive.tue \\n\\nAnnual.miles.drive \\nCredit.score \\nLeft.turn.intensity08 \\nPct.drive.tue \\n\\nAnnual.pct.driven* \\nRight.turn.intensity10* \\nPct.drive.rush pm** \\nPct.drive.rush am** \\n\\n3 Agg_Acc \\nAnnual.pct.driven \\nAnnual.miles.drive \\nPct.drive.rush am \\n\\nCar.age \\nAnnual.miles.drive \\nPct.drive.tue \\nBrake.14miles \\n\\nAnnual.pct.driven* \\nTerritory*  \\n\\nPct.drive.tue** \\nCredit.score** \\n\\n*Denotes coeff values that contributed to drivers identified as not a risk or \\n‘ClaimsYN’=0. \\n**Denotes drivers identified as a risk or ‘ClaimsYN’=1. \\n\\nK.

However, TabNet provides both features’ impor-\\ntance and interior decision masks. The returned feature scores from \\nTabNet indicate a clearly chosen feature as significant to model de-\\ncisions, leaving no ambiguity in model choice. Additional features that \\nscore highly are also distinct from low-scoring features. The addition of \\nthe decision mask enables further insight into the model decision pro-\\ncess. The Attentive Transformer does not retain features that do not \\ncontribute to model decisions, and the output from the decision mask \\ncaptures this process. Gaining access to these decisions is simple and \\ndoes not require additional software packages. TabNet’s ability to easily \\nprovide model interpretability can bridge this gap in using DL in in-\\nsurance as these properties will enable insurers to provide auditors or \\nregulatory bodies with sufficient model information to be regulatory \\ncompliant. \\n\\n5.3. Data trends \\n\\nThe returned features’ importance for each model assists in discov-\\nering trends in the telematics or policyholder data. An important \\nconsideration for insurers should be the value of investing in bespoke \\ninsurance products and whether these additional features contribute to \\nmodel decisions. The returned features’ importances for each model \\nvary in their assigned importances to traditional or telematics data. \\n\\nThese decisions from the model help insurers target certain behaviors or \\ncharacteristics and offer specific and competitive bespoke insurance \\nproducts. The chosen model must identify realistic and accessible fea-\\ntures with relative accuracy to achieve this. For instance, Logistic \\nRegression and XGBoost both identified Car.age and Credit.Score as a \\nsignificant contributor to model decisions. These features are likely to \\ninfer a driver’s risk; however, traditional risk metrics such as Annual. \\nmiles.drive have historically contributed to risk (Bian, Yang, Zhao, & \\nLiang, 2018; Boucher et al., 2017) and thus should have been rated \\nhigher. \\n\\nTelematics data offers significant insights into driver behavior and, \\ntherefore, should be an indicator of risk. However, out of the three \\nmodels tested, TabNet was the only model that consistently identified \\ntelematics variables as significant contributors to driver risk. Compared \\nto TabNet, the Logistic Regression model sporadically identified fea-\\ntures, indicating poor model performance. The high f1 and recall scores \\nreturned by TabNet also reflect TabNet’s ability to identify these risk \\nindicators over the other models. Additionally, TabNet’s ability to \\nidentify these risk indicators accurately will provide insurers with \\ngreater insights into their telematics data. \\n\\n6. Conclusion \\n\\nThis paper provides a comprehensive overview of TabNet’s \\n\\nFig. 3. Feature masks for TabNet. The highlighted features in each graph display the output from each feature mask at a given step. Each row indicates the levels of \\npre-processing. Additionally, color gradients signify the importance of a feature at that stage of testing, with yellow features indicating a significant contribution and \\npurple the lowest. The x-axis refers to rows of test data, and the y-axis refers to the index of feature values. The final row has only two masks due to the optimal steps \\nchosen as two, as each step outputs a corresponding mask. \\n\\nK.

When compared against these models, \\nTabNet surpasses the performance of XGBoost and Logistic Regression. \\nTabNet is a highly performant DL architecture for insurers, capable of \\nidentifying driver risk from telematics data. This model also provides \\nhighly interpretable results and identifies valuable data trends, another \\nimportant consideration for insurance risk pricing. \\n\\nThe usage of DL models in insurance risk pricing is underutilized due \\nto their low model interpretability and poor generalization on tabular \\ndatasets. Additionally, GLM models and XGBoost require extensive \\nmodel building processes or return poor model interpretability. This \\nnovel approach introduces TabNet for driver risk identification. TabNet \\nprovides high accuracy and model interpretability and can identify risky \\ndrivers from telematics and policyholder data. \\n\\nComparing the performance of each model, TabNet was best suited \\nto capture the sparsity of claims within the dataset, returning the highest \\nf1-scores in two out three rounds, scoring 0.59 & 0.6, respectively. \\nAdditionally, no other model scored higher than TabNet in Recall. The \\nperformance of XGBoost was also comparable to TabNet. XGBoost \\nconsistently returned high precision, accuracy, and AUC values and, in \\nthe first round of testing, returned the highest f1-score. However, Lo-\\ngistic Regression could not generalize on the dataset and could never \\naccurately capture the sparsity in claims. Thus, model performance \\nnever improved despite efforts to optimize the model. Additionally, the \\nfinal set of tests conducted using LightGBM and NN could not accurately \\npredict claims. As a result, neither model could surpass TabNet’s or \\nXGBoost’s scores. \\n\\nThis study identifies model interpretability as TabNet’s key contri-\\nbution for usage in insurance risk pricing. Each model could identify a \\nsignificant feature that contributed to model decisions; however, \\nXGBoost, in particular, could not provide clarity over the decisions \\nmade. On the other hand, TabNet excelled in this field, returning chosen \\nfeatures of significance with clarity while also providing local model \\ninterpretability. Furthermore, obtaining the decision masks from Tab-\\nNet is a simple process, and each mask displays the decisions made by \\nthe model at that particular step. Finally, the coefficients returned from \\nLogistic Regression provide interpretable results; however, clarity was \\ndifficult to obtain due to poor model performance. This problem per-\\nsisted with the LightGBM and NN models, as both models performed \\n\\npoorly on the claims prediction task. The NN, in particular, demon-\\nstrated a significant challenge in obtaining model decisions, further \\nendorsing TabNet’s interpretable qualities. \\n\\nAnother important consideration for this study was evaluating each \\nmodel’s ability to identify telematics and policyholder data trends. \\nIdentifying specific trends in the data is invaluable to insurers, as they \\ncan offer tailored bespoke insurance products for their policyholders. \\nBoth XGBoost and Logistic Regression failed in this aspect, returning \\ninsights that would not benefit the insurer. Conversely, TabNet offered \\nsignificant insights into data trends, identifying traditionally significant \\nfeatures such as annual mileage and telematics features as contributors \\nto risk. \\n\\nTabNet tended to overfit the data despite these aforementioned \\nbenefits and required extensive effort to train and tune the model \\ncorrectly. Additionally, training the model was a time-consuming pro-\\ncess with sometimes minimal reward. XGBoost, in comparison, could \\nachieve comparable performance with minimal effort. \\n\\nCRediT authorship contribution statement \\n\\nKevin McDonnell: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, \\nFormal analysis, Writing – original draft, Writing – review & editing. \\nFinbarr Murphy: Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing – review & \\nediting.
