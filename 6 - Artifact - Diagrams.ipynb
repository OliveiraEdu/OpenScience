    "### Summary:\n",
    "This diagram represents the architecture of an Open Science Platform that integrates blockchain for user and project account management, and IPFS for decentralized file storage. The flow shows how user actions on the platform instantiate accounts on the blockchain, and how project-related data (including files and metadata) are stored in IPFS and linked back to blockchain accounts via CIDs."

    "This diagram presents the flow of actions and interactions between the **Platform**, **Blockchain**, and **IPFS**. It illustrates how users manage projects, files, and metadata across a decentralized storage (IPFS) and a distributed ledger (Blockchain) systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Platform**:\n",
    "   The **Platform** is the front-end interface that facilitates user enrollment and authentication, project creation and material management. It acts as the initial gateway for interactions with the blockchain and IPFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **User**: An individual who interacts with the platform by creating and managing projects. Users can enroll, log in, register projects, and upload materials.\n",
    "   - **Project**: A distinct entity that represents a project, containing various materials, such as files, and metadata.\n",
    "   - **Project Materials**: Digital materials or assets related to the project, such as files and their associated metadata.\n",
    "   - **Metadata**: Descriptive information about the project itself, stored separately from the project files.\n",
    "   - **File**: Digital files (e.g., images, documents, code) that belong to the project.\n",
    "   - **File Metadata**: Metadata about each file (e.g., file type, format, keywords or descriptions).\n",
    "   - **Project Owner**: The user who owns and manages the project and is linked to the project account.\n",
    "   - **Platform**: The front-end that facilitates user enrollment, login, and interaction with the blockchain and IPFS. It bridges user input with decentralized systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Blockchain**:\n",
    "   The **Blockchain** handles the secure, immutable storage of user and project account data, including attributes and ownership links. It keeps records of data stored on IPFS by referencing content identifiers (CIDs).  Also represents blockchain nodes that validate transactions and maintain the decentralized storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **User Account**: A blockchain-based account representing a unique user, instantiated when the user enrolls.\n",
    "   - **Attributes**: Key-value pairs that store on-chain user-related data (e.g., full name, email, institution, ORCID and other identity verification details).\n",
    "   - **Project Account**: Each project on the platform gets its own account on the blockchain, created when a user registers a project.\n",
    "   - **Attributes**: Key-value pairs representing project-specific information on the blockchain (e.g., ownership details, links to CIDs in IPFS).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **IPFS**:\n",
    "   **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)** provides decentralized storage for project materials and metadata. By using unique content identifiers (CIDs), files and metadata can be stored and retrieved efficiently from distributed nodes over the network. Files and metadata are accessible as long as nodes host the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **File**: The actual digital asset (e.g., document, article, dataset, code, image or video) associated with the project, stored in IPFS.\n",
    "   - **File Metadata**: Metadata associated with each file stored on IPFS (e.g., description, creation date, keywords).\n",
    "   - **File CID**: A unique identifier generated by IPFS that points to the specific file content.\n",
    "   - **Project Metadata**: Descriptive metadata related to the project as a whole, such as project name, description, authors, keywords or funding agency.\n",
    "   - **Project Metadata**: The unique content identifier generated by IPFS for the project metadata.\n",
    "   - **File Metadata**: The unique content identifier generated by IPFS for the file metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "This architecture ensures that project materials and metadata are securely stored and accessed in a decentralized manner. The **Platform** acts as the user interface and bridge to decentralized systems, while **Blockchain** records essential attributes and ownership details. **IPFS** ensures that project files and metadata are stored in a decentralized way using CIDs, which are referenced by the blockchain for verification and retrieval purposes. This system provides immutability, transparency, and decentralized access to project-related digital assets."
