To establish that a document was created before a given moment in time, it is necessary to cause an event based on the document, which can be observed by others. Cryptographic hash functions can be used both to report events succinctly, and to cause events based on documents without revealing their contents. Haber and Stornetta have proposed two schemes for digital time-stamping which rely on these principles [HaSt 91].},
