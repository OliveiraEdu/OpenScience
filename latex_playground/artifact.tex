\section{Open Science Platform}

\subsection{Overview}

Traditional centralized systems often exhibit data silos, limited verifiability, and susceptibility to manipulation, impeding the openness and reliability of scientific practices. The decentralized model introduced in this work is designed to mitigate these challenges by enabling efficient data sharing, fostering collaboration, and enhancing the validation of research outputs, thereby strengthening reproducibility and transparency.

This chapter details the design and implementation of the Open Science Platform, a decentralized system that integrates blockchain, IPFS, and smart contracts to improve research reproducibility. By leveraging immutable records and decentralized storage, the platform ensures transparent and verifiable research artifact management. Additionally, extended services are incorporated to facilitate file indexing, metadata extraction, and search functionality. The proposed platform aligns with Open Science principles by providing verifiable and persistently traceable access to research artifacts.

\end{figure}


\subsection{System Components and Interactions in the Open Science Platform}

The Open Science Platform consists of multiple interconnected components, each serving a distinct role in ensuring secure, verifiable, and reproducible research data management. The primary components include Jupyter Server, the blockchain Hyperledger Iroha v1 and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). Each of these elements are encapsulated within a Docker container to provide modularity, ease of deployment and reproducibility.

\subsubsection{Jupyter Server}
The Jupyter Server acts as the primary interface for users interacting with the platform. This component provides a Python kernel for the execution environment that integrates the Iroha v1 Library, the IPFS HTTPS client, Apache Tika for metadata handling, and the Woosh Indexer and Search system. It enables users to:

\begin{itemize}
      \item Execute Python scripts to submit transactions and queries to the blockchain via smart contracts.
      \item Upload and retrieve files and metadata (JSON objects) stored in IPFS.
      \item Process and index research data using Apache Tika and Woosh for enhanced searchability.
      \item Access and visualize blockchain-stored metadata for Open Science applications.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Blockchain}
The blockchain runs based on a Hyperledger Iroha v1 network and acts as a distributed ledger for recording transactions. It ensures immutability, transparency, and verifiability of stored research metadata. This component:
\begin{itemize}
      \item Receives transactions from the Jupyter Server via a gRPC API.
      \item Stores metadata references, ensuring that uploaded research artifacts can be authenticated.
      \item Interacts with PostgreSQL for structured storage of blockchain metadata.
      \item Supports smart contracts through the integration of Hyperledger Burrow, which provides a modular blockchain client with a permissioned smart contract interpreter partially developed to the specification of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Storage}
The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a decentralized storage solution that manages the research outputs. This component:
\begin{itemize}
      \item Stores digital research artifacts in a content-addressed manner.
      \item Allows the Jupyter Server to upload and retrieve files via an HTTPS API.
      \item Ensures long-term availability of scientific data through distributed storage principles.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Relational Database (PostgreSQL)}
The PostgreSQL database provides structured storage for blockchain-related data. It is used exclusively and managed by Iroha v1 to:
\begin{itemize}
      \item Maintain an efficient and queryable record of transactions.
      \item Ensure that research metadata stored on the blockchain can be retrieved and verified.
      \item Support blockchain operations requiring fast access to structured data.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Component Interactions}
The components interact in aseamless and decentralized manner:
\begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{User Interaction}: The user submits transactions, uploads files, and queries research data through the Jupyter Server.
      \item \textbf{Blockchain Transactions}: Jupyter Server sends and retrieves research metadata to the Iroha blockchain via gRPC API.
      \item \textbf{Metadata Storage}: Iroha stores data in the PostgreSQL database for efficient retrieval.
      \item \textbf{Decentralized Storage}: Research artifacts are stored in IPFS, with their unique file identifiers recorded on the blockchain.
      \item \textbf{File Retrieval}: Users can retrieve files from IPFS using their content identifiers (CID), ensuring authenticity and reproducibility.
\end{enumerate}

This architecture guarantees trustworthy and reproducible scientific research by leveraging blockchain for integrity, IPFS for decentralized storage, and Jupyter as an accessible research environment.

      \caption{Componentdiagram for the Open Science Platform}
      \label{fig:c4_component_diagram}
\end{figure}




\subsection{Platform Operations}
The platform supports a set of core operations that regulate user interactions with projects and data management.

\begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{User Self-Enrollment} – A user self-enrolls on the platform by providing a private key that complies with the ED25519 or SHA-3 standards and identity information, including full name, institution, email, ORCID, and role. An account is created for the user in the blockchain. All data provided in the enrollment is structured in key/value pairs into a JSON object and uploaded to IPFS, with the corresponding Content Identifier (CID) recorded on the blockchain attributes of the user account.

      \item \textbf{Project Registration} – Users can register a project by specifying a descriptive name, an abstract, relevant keywords, start and end dates, funding agency, and location. Upon registration, a blockchain account is created. This data is structured in key/value pairs into a JSON object and uploaded to IPFS, with the corresponding Content Identifier (CID) recorded on the blockchain attributes of the project account.


      \item \textbf{User and Project Accounts Linkage} – Once both user and project accounts are created, the system updates their attributes to establish a bidirectional association. This ensures that querying a user account reveals linked project accounts, and vice versa, facilitating traceability and efficient project management.
\end{itemize}


\begin{figure}[htbp]

      \caption{User enrollment and project registering for the Open Science Platform}
      \label{fig:c4_operations_diagram}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Artifact Management}

\begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{File Upload} – A user may upload research artifacts, including papers, datasets, and images. Each file is stored on IPFS, generating a unique Content Identifier (CID) that ensures traceability and integrity. The CID is then recorded on the blockchain attributes of the project, establishing a verifiable reference to the artifact.

      \item \textbf{Metadata Extraction and Storage} – After the upload,the file available metadata is extracted. The extracted metadata is structured in key/value pairs into a JSON object and uploaded to IPFS, with the corresponding Content Identifier (CID) recorded on the attributes of the project account in the blockchain, ensuring metadata provenance and verification.

      \item \textbf{Indexing} – To facilitate efficient retrieval, the system indexes the metadata of every uploaded file, including full text indexing for text based files.

      \item \textbf{Searching} – Users can perform keyword-based searches to locate relevant research artifacts, with search results displaying metadata details, including descriptions, subject and authorship.
\end{itemize}

      \label{fig:c4_keyword_search}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Validation and Download}

\begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{File Validation} – To ensure data integrity and authenticity, the platform verifies whether the CID of a file stored on IPFS matches the CID recorded on the blockchain. A discrepancy between these identifiers signals potential tampering or corruption.

      \item \textbf{File Download} – The system retrieves and downloads validated files from IPFS to the user local file system for later usage.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}



\subsection{Entity-Relationship Model for the Open Science Platform}

The entity-relationship model for the Open Science Platform defines the logical structure of users and research projects, capturing the associations between these entities. The primary entities in this model are \texttt{User} and \texttt{Project}, which are connected through an ownership relationship.


\begin{figure}[htbp]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.98\textwidth, keepaspectratio]{entity_relationship_model.eps}
      \caption{Entity-relationship model for the Open Science Platform}
      \label{fig:er_model}
\end{figure}



\subsection{User Entity}
The \texttt{User} entity represents an individual interacting with the platform. Each user is uniquely identified by an account ID and has attributes that describe personal and institutional information. The attributes of the \texttt{User} entity are listed in Table \ref{tab:user_attributes}.

\begin{table}[h]
      \centering
      \caption{Attributes of the User entity}
      \label{tab:user_attributes}
      \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
            \hline
            \textbf{Attribute}   & \textbf{Description}                             \\ \hline
            \texttt{account\_id} & A unique identifier assigned to the user         \\ \hline
            \texttt{full\_name}  & The complete name of the user                    \\ \hline

            \texttt{institution} & The organization to which the user is affiliated \\ \hline
            \texttt{orcid}       & The Open Researcher and Contributor ID           \\ \hline
            \texttt{role}        & The role of the user within the platform         \\ \hline
      \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Project Entity}
The \texttt{Project} entity represents a research project registered in the platform. It contains essential metadata to describe the project and facilitate discovery and collaboration. The attributes of the \texttt{Project} entity are listed in Table \ref{tab:project_attributes}.

\begin{table}[h]
      \centering
      \caption{Attributes of the Project entity}
      \label{tab:project_attributes}
      \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
            \hline
            \textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Description}                                    \\ \hline
            \texttt{id}        & A unique identifier assigned to the project             \\ \hline
            \texttt{name}      & The official name of the project                        \\ \hline

            \texttt{keywords}  & A list of relevant keywords associated with the project \\ \hline
            \texttt{startDate} & The date when the project officially begins             \\ \hline
            \texttt{endDate}   & The date when the project is expected to conclude       \\ \hline
            \texttt{city}      & The city where the project is primarily conducted       \\ \hline
            \texttt{country}   & The country associated with the research project        \\ \hline
      \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Ownership Relationship}
A \texttt{User} owns one or more \texttt{Project} entities, establishing a one-to-many relationship. This means that a single user can be responsible for multiple projects, but each project is owned by exactly one user. This relationship is crucial for managing project access, ensuring accountability, and maintaining provenance of research activities. This model ensures a structured representation of research projects and their associated users, supporting an organized approach to data management in the Open Science Platform.

\subsection{Hyperledger Iroha v1 Data Model}


The entity-relationship (ER) model represents a permissioned blockchain system, likely based on Hyperledger Iroha. This model defines the core entities, their attributes, and relationships to enable role-based access control, asset management, and multi-signature security.

\section{Core Entities and Their Attributes}

      \label{tab:account_attributes}
      \begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
            \hline
            \textbf{Attribute}   & \textbf{Description}                                            \\ \hline
            \texttt{account\_id} & Unique identifier of the account                                \\ \hline
            \texttt{domain\_id}  & Links the account to a specific domain                          \\ \hline
            \texttt{quorum}      & Required number of signatories for multi-signature transactions \\ \hline

      \item A \texttt{role} can have multiple \texttt{permissions}.
      \item An \texttt{account} can be linked to multiple \texttt{roles}, \texttt{signatories}, and \texttt{assets}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Many-to-Many Relationships}
\begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{account\_has\_roles}: An account can have multiple roles; a role can be assigned to multiple accounts.
      \item \texttt{role\_has\_permissions}: A role can have multiple permissions, and each permission can belong to multiple roles.
      \item \texttt{account\_has\_grantable\_permissions}: An account can delegate specific permissions to multiple others.
\end{itemize}


\begin{figure}[htbp]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.98\textwidth, keepaspectratio]{iroha_v1_er_model.eps}
      \caption{Iroha v1 Entity-relationship model}
      \label{fig:iroha_v1_er_model}
\end{figure}


This ER model follows Hyperledger Iroha’s permissioned blockchain structure. It ensures fine-grained access control, multi-signature security, and domain-based account management. The model enables role-based permissions and asset tracking, making it well-suited for financial applications, identity management, and blockchain-based ecosystems.


\subsection{Relationship Between the Open Science Platform ER Model and the Iroha v1 ER Model}

The Open Science Platform ER model leverages the entity structure of the Iroha v1 ER model, particularly the \texttt{account} class, to represent both the \texttt{User} and \texttt{Project} entities. In this approach, instead of introducing separate relational tables for users and projects, the \texttt{account} entity in the Iroha v1 ER model serves as a general-purpose representation, encapsulating all necessary attributes in a structured format.

The attributes specific to users and projects, which are not natively present in the Iroha v1 \texttt{account} entity, are stored as JSON objects within the \texttt{data} field of the \texttt{account} table. This design provides a flexible and scalable means of extending the entity's attributes without modifying the core schema of the Iroha blockchain.

From a relational perspective, the \texttt{account} entity maintains its standard associations with roles, permissions, and assets as defined in the Iroha v1 ER model. This ensures that user accounts and project accounts can both participate in the blockchain's permissioning system, asset ownership model, and role-based access control without requiring modifications to the underlying structure.

By reusing the \texttt{account} entity, the Open Science Platform ER model ensures compatibility with Iroha's existing mechanisms for identity management, cryptographic signing, and permission delegation. Additionally, this approach aligns with the decentralized and immutable nature of blockchain, ensuring that both user and project entities benefit from the security and transparency features inherent to the Iroha v1 framework.

      \caption{Comparing ER models}
      \label{fig:comparing_er_models}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Metadata Representation}


To standardize metadata representation and enhance interoperability, three key ontologies were incorporated: \textbf{FOAF (Friend of a Friend)}, \textbf{Dublin Core}, and \textbf{Schema.org}. These vocabularies provide a common semantic framework that facilitates integration with other systems based on W3C standards, such as knowledge graphs and linked data environments. FOAF is particularly useful for modeling user identity and social connections, Dublin Core provides metadata descriptors for digital assets, and Schema.org enhances discoverability by aligning with web-based search engines and indexing mechanisms.



\subsection{Metadata}

Metadata in the context of the platform has a two fold approach. The first is related to the identity of an user account, holding key value pairs of attributes related to the user such as full name, email, institution, ORCID.


\begin{verbatim}
      {
          "@context": {
              "schema": "http://schema.org/",
              "foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"
