    "### Summary:\n",
    "This UML class diagram documents the core objects of the platform. It shows how users, projects, and materials (files) interact, how the blockchain stores user and project accounts, and how IPFS is used to store files and metadata in a decentralized manner. The platform acts as the main entry point, allowing users to manage their projects and ensuring secure storage and retrieval through the blockchain and IPFS."

    "### **C4 Diagrams Documentation for the Platform**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The C4 (Context, Container, Component, Deployment) diagrams provide a comprehensive view of the architecture of the Project Management Platform, which integrates blockchain technology (Hyperledger Iroha 1) and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). These diagrams illustrate the interactions between various components of the system, detailing user account management, project functionalities, file operations, and data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. C4 Context Diagram**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**  \n",

    "\n",
    "- **Actors:**\n",
    "  - **User:** Engages with the platform to manage accounts and projects.\n",
    "  - **Blockchain:** Manages user and project account data securely and immutably.\n",
    "  - **IPFS:** Stores project metadata and uploaded files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Relationships:**\n",
    "- Users interact with the platform to create accounts and manage project details.\n",
    "- The platform communicates with the blockchain to store account information.\n",
    "- The platform utilizes IPFS to handle project metadata and files.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. C4 Container Diagram**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**  \n",
    "The Container diagram breaks down the platform into its main components, illustrating how each part interacts with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Containers:**\n",
    "  - **API Application:** Handles requests from the web application and interfaces with other services.\n",
    "  - **Web Application:** Provides the frontend interface for user interaction.\n",
    "  - **Database:** Stores user and project account information.\n",
    "  - **FileController:** Manages file uploads and integrates with IPFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Relationships:**\n",
    "- The web application communicates with the API to access backend functionalities.\n",
    "- The API interacts with the database for data storage and retrieval.\n",
    "- The FileController handles uploads to IPFS and links file CIDs to project accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. C4 Component Diagram**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**  \n",
    "The Component diagram provides a detailed view of the API Application, highlighting the internal components and their responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Components:**\n",
    "  - **UserController:** Manages user account operations.\n",
    "  - **ProjectController:** Handles project-related functionalities.\n",
    "  - **Security Component:** Manages authentication and authorization processes.\n",
    "  - **FileController:** Handles the uploading of files to IPFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Relationships:**\n",
    "- The UserController and ProjectController interact with the Security Component for authentication.\n",
    "- The FileController interacts with IPFS to upload files and retrieve CIDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. C4 Deployment Diagram**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**  \n",
    "The Deployment diagram illustrates the physical architecture of the system, detailing how software components are deployed on hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deployment Nodes:**\n",
    "  - **Project Management Server:** Hosts the application on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.\n",
    "  - **App Server:** Runs the API application on Apache Tomcat.\n",
    "  - **Web Server:** Delivers the web application.\n",
    "  - **Database Server:** Hosts the SQL Database for storing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Relationships:**\n",
    "- The web application makes API calls to the App Server.\n",
    "- The API application reads from and writes to the database.\n",
    "- The FileController uploads files to IPFS and retrieves file CIDs for storage in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "The C4 diagrams collectively offer a detailed architecture of the Project Management Platform, illustrating how various components interact to facilitate user account management, project functionalities, and file operations. This architecture ensures data integrity through blockchain technology while leveraging IPFS for decentralized storage, enhancing the platform's robustness and scalability for project management activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "\n",
    "This improved documentation is structured to clearly present the purpose and key elements of each C4 diagram, making it easier for stakeholders to understand the architecture and interactions within the Project Management Platform."
