    "This diagram presents the flow of actions and interactions between the **Platform**, **Blockchain**, and **IPFS**. It illustrates how users manage projects, files, and metadata across a decentralized storage (IPFS) and a distributed ledger (Blockchain) systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Platform**:\n",
    "   The **Platform** is the front-end interface that facilitates user enrollment and authentication, project creation and material management. It acts as the initial gateway for interactions with the blockchain and IPFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **User**: An individual who interacts with the platform by creating and managing projects. Users can enroll, log in, register projects, and upload materials.\n",
    "   - **Project**: A distinct entity that represents a project, containing various materials, such as files, and metadata.\n",
    "   - **Project Materials**: Digital materials or assets related to the project, such as files and their associated metadata.\n",
    "   - **Metadata**: Descriptive information about the project itself, stored separately from the project files.\n",
    "   - **File**: Digital files (e.g., images, documents, code) that belong to the project.\n",
    "   - **File Metadata**: Metadata about each file (e.g., file type, format, keywords or descriptions).\n",
    "   - **Project Owner**: The user who owns and manages the project and is linked to the project account.\n",
    "   - **Platform**: The front-end that facilitates user enrollment, login, and interaction with the blockchain and IPFS. It bridges user input with decentralized systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Blockchain**:\n",
    "   The **Blockchain** handles the secure, immutable storage of user and project account data, including attributes and ownership links. It keeps records of data stored on IPFS by referencing content identifiers (CIDs).  Also representes blockchain nodes that validate transactions and maintain the decentralized storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **User Account**: A blockchain-based account representing a unique user, instantiated when the user enrolls.\n",
    "   - **Attributes**: Key-value pairs that store on-chain user-related data (e.g., full name, email, institution, ORCID and other identity verification details).\n",
    "   - **Project Account**: Each project on the platform gets its own account on the blockchain, created when a user registers a project.\n",
    "   - **Attributes**: Key-value pairs representing project-specific information on the blockchain (e.g., ownership details, links to CIDs in IPFS).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **IPFS**:\n",
    "   **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)** provides decentralized storage for project materials and metadata. By using unique content identifiers (CIDs), files and metadata can be stored and retrieved efficiently from distributed nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Decentralized Nodes (L)**: A network of nodes responsible for storing and distributing files in IPFS. Files and metadata are accessible as long as nodes host the content.\n",
    "   - **File (M)**: The actual digital asset (e.g., image, document, or video) associated with the project, stored in IPFS.\n",
    "   - **File Metadata (N)**: Metadata associated with each file stored on IPFS (e.g., description, creation date).\n",
    "   - **File CID (O)**: A unique identifier generated by IPFS that points to the specific file content.\n",
    "   - **Project Metadata (P)**: Descriptive metadata related to the project as a whole, such as project name, description, or category.\n",
    "   - **Project Metadata CID (Q)**: The unique content identifier generated by IPFS for the project metadata.\n",
    "   - **File Metadata CID (R)**: The unique content identifier generated by IPFS for the file metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Flows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Enrollment and Authentication**:\n",
    "   - **T --> A**: The platform facilitates the enrollment or login of the user.\n",
    "   - **A --> B**: The user registers a project on the platform.\n",
    "   - **A --> G**: The user is identified as the project owner after registering a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Project and Material Management**:\n",
    "   - **B --> C**: The registered project contains materials, including files and their associated metadata.\n",
    "   - **C --> D**: Each project has metadata that provides descriptive information about the project.\n",
    "   - **C --> E**: The project includes files as project materials.\n",
    "   - **C --> F**: The project also includes metadata specific to each file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Blockchain Operations**:\n",
    "   - **A --> H**: Upon registration, the user instantiates a blockchain account to store personal attributes.\n",
    "   - **H --> I**: The user account stores key-value pairs containing user-related attributes (e.g., identity information).\n",
    "   - **B --> J**: The platform creates a blockchain-based project account for each project.\n",
    "   - **J --> K**: The project account stores project-specific attributes, including ownership and IPFS content identifiers.\n",
    "   - **G <-->|Links| K**: The project owner's attributes are linked to the project's blockchain account, establishing ownership.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **IPFS Storage**:\n",
    "   - **D --> P**: The project metadata is stored in IPFS.\n",
    "   - **E --> M**: The project files are stored in IPFS.\n",
    "   - **F --> N**: The file metadata is stored in IPFS.\n",
    "   - **M --> O**: IPFS generates a unique CID for each stored file.\n",
    "   - **P --> Q**: IPFS generates a unique CID for the project metadata.\n",
    "   - **N --> R**: IPFS generates a unique CID for the file metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Blockchain References to IPFS**:\n",
    "   - **O --> K**: The file CID is stored on the blockchain in the project account's attributes.\n",
    "   - **Q --> K**: The project metadata CID is also stored in the project account's attributes.\n",
    "   - **R --> K**: The file metadata CID is similarly stored in the project account's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "This architecture ensures that project materials and metadata are securely stored and accessed in a decentralized manner. The **Platform** acts as the user interface and bridge to decentralized systems, while **Blockchain** records essential attributes and ownership details. **IPFS** ensures that project files and metadata are stored in a decentralized way using CIDs, which are referenced by the blockchain for verification and retrieval purposes. This system provides immutability, transparency, and decentralized access to project-related digital assets."
