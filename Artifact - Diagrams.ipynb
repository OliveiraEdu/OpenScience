    "#### **1. Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "This unified class diagram represents a platform that integrates the blockchain Hyperledger Iroha 1 and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for the  management of interactions between user and project accounts. The platform involves various actors performing tasks such as creating accounts, setting details, linking accounts, querying data, and storing/retrieving metadata using IPFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Key Classes and Responsibilities**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **User**  \n",
    "The **User** class represents the entity responsible for interacting with the blockchain to create user and project accounts and set their respective details. It provides key operations like:\n",
    "- **createAccount(accountType):** Initiates account creation on the blockchain for either user or project.\n",
    "- **setDetails(accountType):** Sets account-specific details in the blockchain.\n",
    "- **dumpAccount(accountType):** Dumps account data (user or project) into a CSV file for future reference.\n",
    "- **extractFromCSV(csvFile):** Extracts account data from CSV for linking user and project accounts.\n",
    "- **linkToProject(projectAccount):** Links a user to a project account, establishing a logical relationship between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **ProjectAccount**  \n",
    "This class represents a specific type of account, namely a project account. Key responsibilities include:\n",
    "- **linkToUser(userAccount):** Links the project account back to a user account, enabling future references between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Blockchain**  \n",
    "The **Blockchain** class manages all blockchain operations. It interacts with the **UserAccount** and **ProjectAccount** objects, ensuring that user and project data are stored immutably:\n",
    "- **queryUserAccountDetails:** Retrieves user account data.\n",
    "- **queryProjectAccountDetails:** Retrieves project account data.\n",
    "- **deployContract:** Deploys smart contracts for account creation or setting details.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Contract**  \n",
    "The **Contract** is an abstract class that represents the smart contract mechanism used in the blockchain. It has two specialized contracts:\n",
    "- **CreateAccountContract:** A contract to create user or project accounts.\n",
    "- **SetDetailsContract:** A contract to set or update the details of accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **CSVFile** and **ProjectCSVFile**  \n",
    "Both classes manage file operations for dumping and reading account data. **CSVFile** is responsible for user-related data, while **ProjectCSVFile** handles project-specific accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Linking and Data Management**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **LinkDetails**  \n",
    "This class establishes the logical link between user and project accounts by storing both IDs. The blockchain is queried to verify the link. Its methods include:\n",
    "- **setLink():** Sets the link between the user and project.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Platform and External Systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Platform**  \n",
    "The **Platform** acts as a middleware system that:\n",
    "- Queries the **Blockchain** for user and project account details.\n",
    "- Sends metadata **CID** (Content Identifier) to **IPFS** for fetching project metadata.\n",
    "- Displays the fetched metadata on the **FrontEnd**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **IPFS**  \n",
    "The **IPFS (Interplanetary File System)** stores project metadata referenced by a **CID**. The class provides:\n",
    "- **fetchMetadata(cid):** Fetches metadata from IPFS using a CID.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **FrontEnd**  \n",
    "This class represents the user interface where project metadata is displayed. It is responsible for:\n",
    "- **display(jsonData):** Displays the JSON data of project metadata retrieved from IPFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Metadata Storage and Retrieval**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **ProjectMetadata**  \n",
    "This class represents the project metadata stored in **IPFS**. It contains:\n",
    "- **metadataJson:** The actual JSON metadata for the project.\n",
    "- **cid:** The content identifier that references the metadata in IPFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "This class diagram depicts a highly structured system that integrates **Blockchain**, **IPFS**, and a platform that manages user and project accounts. It ensures data integrity through the blockchain while enabling decentralized storage and retrieval of project metadata via IPFS. Logical links between users and projects allow for future reference and validation, enhancing the system’s robustness for activities such as reproducibility, data tracking, and verification."
